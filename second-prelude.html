    <h3>Jesus Paid it All</h3>

    <p>1. I hear the Savior say,</p>
    <p>“Your strength indeed is small,</p>
    <p>child of weakness, watch and pray,</p>
    <p>find in me your all in all.”</p>
    <p>Jesus paid it all,</p>
    <p>all to him I owe;</p>
    <p>sin had left a crimson stain,</p>
    <p>he washed it white as snow.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Lord, now indeed I find</p>
    <p>your pow’r and yours alone,</p>
    <p>can change the leper’s spots</p>
    <p>and melt the heart of stone.</p>
    <p>Jesus paid it all,</p>
    <p>all to him I owe;</p>
    <p>sin had left a crimson stain,</p>
    <p>he washed it white as snow.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. For nothing good have I,</p>
    <p>whereby your grace to claim—</p>
    <p>I’ll wash my garments white</p>
    <p>in the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb.</p>
    <p>Jesus paid it all,</p>
    <p>all to him I owe;</p>
    <p>sin had left a crimson stain,</p>
    <p>he washed it white as snow.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. And when, before the throne,</p>
    <p>I stand in him complete,</p>
    <p>“Jesus died my soul to save,”</p>
    <p>my lips shall still repeat.</p>
    <p>Jesus paid it all,</p>
    <p>all to him I owe;</p>
    <p>sin had left a crimson stain,</p>
    <p>he washed it white as snow.</p>
