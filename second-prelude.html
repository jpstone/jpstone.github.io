    <h3>He Arose!</h3>

    <p>Low in the grave He lay</p>
    <p>Jesus my Savior!</p>
    <p>Waiting the coming day</p>
    <p>Jesus my Lord!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Up from the grave He arose,</p>
    <p>With a mighty triumph o’er His foes</p>
    <p>He arose a Victor from the dark domain,</p>
    <p>And He lives forever with His saints to reign.</p>
    <p>He arose! He arose!</p>
    <p>Hallelujah! Christ arose!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Vainly they watch His bed</p>
    <p>Jesus, my Savior!</p>
    <p>Vainly they seal the dead</p>
    <p>Jesus my Lord!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Up from the grave He arose,</p>
    <p>With a mighty triumph o’er His foes</p>
    <p>He arose a Victor from the dark domain,</p>
    <p>And He lives forever with His saints to reign.</p>
    <p>He arose! He arose!</p>
    <p>Hallelujah! Christ arose!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Death cannot keep his prey</p>
    <p>Jesus, my Savior!</p>
    <p>He tore the bars away</p>
    <p>Jesus my Lord!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Up from the grave He arose,</p>
    <p>With a mighty triumph o’er His foes</p>
    <p>He arose a Victor from the dark domain,</p>
    <p>And He lives forever with His saints to reign.</p>
    <p>He arose! He arose!</p>
    <p>Hallelujah! Christ arose!</p>
