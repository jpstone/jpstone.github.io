    <h3>Psalm 22 (Be Not Far Off)</h3>

    <p>Be not far off, for grief is near,</p>
    <p>and none to help is found;</p>
    <p>For bulls of Bashan in their strength</p>
    <p>now circle me around.</p>
    <p>Their lion jaws they open wide,</p>
    <p>and roar to tear their prey.</p>
    <p>My heart is wax, my bones unknit,</p>
    <p>my life is poured away.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My strength only broken clay;</p>
    <p>my mouth and tongue are dry;</p>
    <p>For in the very dust of death</p>
    <p>You there make me to lie.</p>
    <p>For see how dogs encircle me!</p>
    <p>On every side there stands</p>
    <p>a brotherhood of cruelty;</p>
    <p>they pierce my feet and hands.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My bones are plain for me to count;</p>
    <p>men see me and they stare.</p>
    <p>My clothes among them they divide,</p>
    <p>and gamble for their share.</p>
    <p>Now hurry, O my strength, to help!</p>
    <p>Be not far off, O Lord!</p>
    <p>But snatch my soul from raging dogs,</p>
    <p>and spare me from the sword.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Let those that fear the Lord sing praise!</p>
    <p>To him give glory now,</p>
    <p>all Jacob’s seed, all Israel’s seed,</p>
    <p>in awe before him bow.</p>
    <p>For he did not despise nor spurn</p>
    <p>the grief of one oppressed,</p>
    <p>nor did he shun his cry for help,</p>
    <p>but heard and gave him rest.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When I proclaim my praise of you,</p>
    <p>then all the church will hear,</p>
    <p>and I will pay my vows in full</p>
    <p>where men hold him in fear.</p>
    <p>The weak and poor will eat their fill</p>
    <p>and thus be satisfied.</p>
    <p>Those seeking him will praise the Lord.</p>
    <p>So let your hearts abide.</p>
    <br>
    <p>All ends of earth will turn to him,</p>
    <p>remembering the Lord,</p>
    <p>all fam’lies of the earth shall come</p>
    <p>and worship and adore.</p>
    <p>Dominion to the Lord belongs;</p>
    <p>he rules the nations well.</p>
    <p>The proud of all the earth will bow</p>
    <p>before him where he dwells.</p>
    <br>
    <p>All those whose souls descend to dust</p>
    <p>will fall before his throne;</p>
    <p>they cannot keep themselves alive,</p>
    <p>they rest on him alone.</p>
    <p>A seed shall serve him; future sons</p>
    <p>will hear about the Lord.</p>
    <p>His righteousness they will declare</p>
    <p>to people yet unborn.</p>
