    <h3>Romans 11 Doxology</h3>

    <p>Oh the depth of the riches</p>
    <p>Of the wisdom and knowledge of God</p>
    <p>How unsearchable his judgment</p>
    <p>How untraceable his paths</p>
    <br>
    <p>Who knows the mind of our God</p>
    <p>And who can bring council to Him?</p>
    <p>Who has given to God</p>
    <p>That God should repay?</p>
    <br>
    <p>For from Him, through Him</p>
    <p>To Him, is everything</p>
    <br>
    <p>To God be the glory forever and ever</p>
    <p>To God be the glory forever, amen</p>
