    <h3>My Worth is Not in What I Own</h3>

    <p>My worth is not in what I own</p>
    <p>Not in the strength of flesh and bone</p>
    <p>But in the costly wounds of love</p>
    <p>At the cross</p>
    <br>
    <p>My worth is not in skill or name</p>
    <p>In win or lose, in pride or shame</p>
    <p>But in the blood of Christ that flowed</p>
    <p>at the cross</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">Chorus</p>
    <p>I rejoice in my redeemer</p>
    <p>Greatest treasure, Wellspring of my soul</p>
    <p>I will trust in him no other</p>
    <p>My soul is satisfied in Him alone</p>
    <br>
    <p>As summer flowers we fade and die</p>
    <p>Fame youth and beauty hurry by</p>
    <p>But life eternal calls to us</p>
    <p>At the cross</p>
    <br>
    <p>I will not boast in wealth or might</p>
    <p>Or human wisdomâ€™s fleeting light</p>
    <p>But I will boast in knowing Christ</p>
    <p>At the cross</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">Chorus</p>
    <p>I rejoice in my redeemer</p>
    <p>Greatest treasure, Wellspring of my soul</p>
    <p>I will trust in him no other</p>
    <p>My soul is satisfied in Him alone</p>
    <br>
    <p>Two wonders here that I confess</p>
    <p>My worth and my unworthiness</p>
    <p>My value fixed, my ransom paid</p>
    <p>At the cross</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">Chorus</p>
    <p>I rejoice in my redeemer</p>
    <p>Greatest treasure, Wellspring of my soul</p>
    <p>I will trust in him no other</p>
    <p>My soul is satisfied in Him alone</p>
