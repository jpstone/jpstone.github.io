    <h3>Psalm 91 (On Eagles' Wings)</h3>

    <p>You who dwell</p>
    <p>in the shelter of the Lord,</p>
    <p>Who abide in His shadow for life,</p>
    <p>Say to the Lord, "My refuge,</p>
    <p>My Rock in Whom I trust!"</p>
    <br>
    <p>And He will raise you</p>
    <p>up on eagles’ wings,</p>
    <p>Bear you on the breath of dawn,</p>
    <p>Make you to shine like the sun,</p>
    <p>And hold you in the palm of His hand.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The snare of the fowler</p>
    <p>will never capture you</p>
    <p>And famine will bring you no fear.</p>
    <p>Under His wings your refuge,</p>
    <p>His faithfulness your shield.</p>
    <br>
    <p>And He will raise you</p>
    <p>up on eagles’ wings,</p>
    <p>Bear you on the breath of dawn,</p>
    <p>Make you to shine like the sun,</p>
    <p>And hold you in the palm of His hand.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You need not fear</p>
    <p>the terror of the night,</p>
    <p>Nor the arrow that flies by day.</p>
    <p>Though thousands fall about you,</p>
    <p>Near you it shall not come.</p>
    <br>
    <p>And He will raise you</p>
    <p>up on eagles’ wings,</p>
    <p>Bear you on the breath of dawn,</p>
    <p>Make you to shine like the sun,</p>
    <p>And hold you in the palm of His hand.</p>
