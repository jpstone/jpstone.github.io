    <h3>Psalm 124</h3>

    <p>Now Israel may say, and that in truth,</p>
    <p>If that the Lord had not our right maintained,</p>
    <p>If that the Lord had not with us remained,</p>
    <p>When cruel men against us rose to strive,</p>
    <p>We surely had been swallowed up alive.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Yea when their wrath against us fiercely rose,</p>
    <p>The swelling tide had o'er us spread its wave,</p>
    <p>The raging stream had then become our grave</p>
    <p>The surging flood, in proudly swelling roll,</p>
    <p>Most surely then had overwhelmed our soul.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Blest be the Lord who made us not their prey:</p>
    <p>As from the snare a bird escapeth free,</p>
    <p>Their net is rent and so escaped are we:</p>
    <p>Our only help is in Jehovah's Name,</p>
    <p>Who made the earth and all the heav'nly frame</p>
