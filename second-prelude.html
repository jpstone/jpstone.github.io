    <h3>Be Thou My Vision</h3>

    <p>Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart</p>
    <p>Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art</p>
    <p>Thou my best thought, by day or by night</p>
    <p>Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Be Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true word</p>
    <p>I ever with Thee, and Thou with me, Lord</p>
    <p>Thou my great Father, and I Thy true son;</p>
    <p>Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Be Thou my battle Shield, Sword for the fight</p>
    <p>Be Thou my Dignity, Thou my Delight</p>
    <p>Thou my soul’s Shelter, Thou my high Tow’r:</p>
    <p>Raise Thou me heav’nward, O Pow’r of my pow’r.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise</p>
    <p>Thou mine inheritance now and always:</p>
    <p>Thou and Thou only, first in my heart</p>
    <p>High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.</p>
    <br>
    <p>High King of heaven, my vict’ry won,</p>
    <p>May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun!</p>
    <p>Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,</p>
    <p>Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.</p>
