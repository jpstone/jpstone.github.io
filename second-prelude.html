    <h3>O Church of Christ, Invincible</h3>

    <p>O Church of Christ invincible,</p>
    <p>The people of the Lord;</p>
    <p>Empowered by the Spiritâ€™s breath,</p>
    <p>And nourished by His word.</p>
    <p>His covenant of grace will be</p>
    <p>Our portion evermore;</p>
    <p>For he who called us will not change,</p>
    <p>Our help and our reward</p>
    <br>
    <p>O chosen people called by grace,</p>
    <p>The sons of Abraham,</p>
    <p>Who walk by faith in things unseen</p>
    <p>And on His promise stand,</p>
    <p>That every nation of the earth</p>
    <p>Will hear of boundless love</p>
    <p>That causes broken hearts to heal</p>
    <p>And pays our debts with blood.</p>
    <br>
    <p>O Church of Christ in sorrow now,</p>
    <p>Where evil lies in wait,</p>
    <p>When trials and persecutions come</p>
    <p>This light will never fade.</p>
    <p>For though the hordes of hell may rage,</p>
    <p>Their power will not endure;</p>
    <p>Our times are in the Father&#39;s hand,</p>
    <p>Our anchor is secure.</p>
    <br>
    <p>O Church of Christ upon that day,</p>
    <p>When all are gathered in,</p>
    <p>When every tear is wiped away</p>
    <p>With every trace of sin;</p>
    <p>Where justice, truth and beauty shine,</p>
    <p>And death has passed away;</p>
    <p>Where God and man will dwell as one,</p>
    <p>For all eternity!</p>
