    <h3>It is Well (With My Soul)</h3>

    <p>When peace, like a river,</p>
    <p>attendeth my way,</p>
    <p>When sorrows like sea billows roll;</p>
    <p>Whatever my lot,</p>
    <p>Thou hast taught me to say,</p>
    <p>It is well, it is well</p>
    <p>with my soul.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">(Chorus)</p>
    <p>It is well with my soul,</p>
    <p>It is well, it is well</p>
    <p>with my soul.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Though Satan should buffet,</p>
    <p>though trials should come,</p>
    <p>Let this blest assurance control,</p>
    <p>That Christ hath regarded</p>
    <p>my helpless estate,</p>
    <p>And hath shed His own blood</p>
    <p>for my soul.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My sin—oh, the bliss</p>
    <p>of this glorious thought!—</p>
    <p>My sin, not in part but the whole,</p>
    <p>Is nailed to the cross,</p>
    <p>and I bear it no more,</p>
    <p>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,</p>
    <p>O my soul!</p>
    <br>
    <p>And Lord, haste the day</p>
    <p>when faith shall be sight,</p>
    <p>The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;</p>
    <p>The trump shall resound,</p>
    <p>and the Lord shall descend,</p>
    <p>Even so! It is well</p>
    <p>with my soul.</p>
