    <h3>It is Well With My Soul</h3>

    <p>When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,</p>
    <p>When sorrows like sea billows roll;</p>
    <p>Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,</p>
    <p>It is well, it is well with my soul.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">Refrain:</p>
    <p>It is well with my soul,</p>
    <p>It is well, it is well with my soul.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,</p>
    <p>Let this blest assurance control,</p>
    <p>That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,</p>
    <p>And hath shed His own blood for my soul.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My sin—oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!—</p>
    <p>My sin, not in part but the whole,</p>
    <p>Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,</p>
    <p>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!</p>
    <br>
    <p>For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:</p>
    <p>If Jordan above me shall roll,</p>
    <p>No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life</p>
    <p>Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But, Lord, ’tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,</p>
    <p>The sky, not the grave, is our goal;</p>
    <p>Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord!</p>
    <p>Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul!</p>
    <br>
    <p>And Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,</p>
    <p>The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;</p>
    <p>The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,</p>
    <p>Even so, it is well with my soul.</p>
