    <h3>Behold Our God</h3>

    <p>Who has held the oceans in his hands?</p>
    <p>Who has numbered every grain of sand?</p>
    <p>Kings and nations tremble at his voice;</p>
    <p>All creation rises to rejoice:</p>
    <br>
    <p>Behold our God, seated on his throne;</p>
    <p>Come, let us adore him!</p>
    <p>Behold our king - nothing can compare -</p>
    <p>Come, let us adore him!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Who has given counsel to the Lord?</p>
    <p>Who can question any of his words?</p>
    <p>Who can teach the one who knows all things?</p>
    <p>Who can fathom all his wondrous deeds?</p>
    <br>
    <p>Behold our God, seated on his throne;</p>
    <p>Come, let us adore him!</p>
    <p>Behold our king - nothing can compare -</p>
    <p>Come, let us adore him!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Who has felt the nails upon his hands,</p>
    <p>Bearing all the guilt of sinful man?</p>
    <p>God eternal, humbled to the grave;</p>
    <p>Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Behold our God, seated on his throne;</p>
    <p>Come, let us adore him!</p>
    <p>Behold our king - nothing can compare -</p>
    <p>Come, let us adore him!</p>
