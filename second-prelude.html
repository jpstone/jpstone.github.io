    <h3>It is Well</h3>

    <p>When peace, like a river, attendeth my way;</p>
    <p>When sorrows like sea billows roll;</p>
    <p>Whatever my lot,</p>
    <p>thou hast taught me to say:</p>
    <p>"It is well, it is well with my soul."</p>
    <br>
    <p>It is well           (It is well)</p>
    <p>With my soul         (With my soul)</p>
    <p>It is well, it is well, with my soul!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Though Satan should buffet,</p>
    <p>though trials should come,</p>
    <p>Let this blest assurance control:</p>
    <p>That Christ has regarded</p>
    <p>my helpless estate,</p>
    <p>And hath shed his own blood for my soul.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It is well           (It is well)</p>
    <p>With my soul         (With my soul)</p>
    <p>It is well, it is well, with my soul!</p>
    <br>
    <p>My sin - O, the bliss of this glorious thought!</p>
    <p>My sin, not in part but the whole</p>
    <p>Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more!</p>
    <p>Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord, O my soul!</p>
    <br>
    <p>It is well           (It is well)</p>
    <p>With my soul         (With my soul)</p>
    <p>It is well, it is well, with my soul!</p>
    <br>
    <p>And, Lord, haste the day</p>
    <p>when my faith shall be sight,</p>
    <p>The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;</p>
    <p>The trump shall resound,</p>
    <p>and the Lord shall descend;</p>
    <p>Even so, it is well with my soul.</p>
