    <h3>Joy to the World!</h3>

    <p>Joy to the world, the Lord has come:</p>
    <p>Let earth receive her King!</p>
    <p>Let every heart prepare Him room,</p>
    <p>And heaven and nature sing,</p>
    <p>And heaven and nature sing,</p>
    <p>And heaven, and heaven and nature sing!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Joy to the world, the Savior reigns:</p>
    <p>Let men their songs employ!</p>
    <p>While fields and flood,</p>
    <p>rocks, hills, and plains</p>
    <p>Repeat the sounding joy,</p>
    <p>Repeat the sounding joy,</p>
    <p>Repeat, repeat the sounding joy!</p>
    <br>
    <p>No more let sins and sorrows grow,</p>
    <p>Nor thorns infest the ground.</p>
    <p>He comes to make His blessings flow</p>
    <p>Far as the curse is found,</p>
    <p>Far as the curse is found,</p>
    <p>Far as, far as the curse is found!</p>
    <br>
    <p>He rules the world with truth and grace,</p>
    <p>And makes the nations prove</p>
    <p>The glories of His righteousness</p>
    <p>And wonders of His love,</p>
    <p>And wonders of His love,</p>
    <p>And wonders, wonders of His love!</p>
