    <h3>I Stand Amazed (How Marvelous!)</h3>

    <p>I stand amazed in the presence</p>
    <p>Of Jesus the Nazarene,</p>
    <p>And wonder how he could love me,</p>
    <p>A sinner, condemned, unclean.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">Chorus</p>
    <p>How marvelous! How wonderful!</p>
    <p>And my song shall ever be:</p>
    <p>How marvelous! How wonderful!</p>
    <p>Is my Savior’s love for me!</p>
    <br>
    <p>He took my sins and my sorrows,</p>
    <p>He made them His very own;</p>
    <p>He bore the burden to Calv’ry,</p>
    <p>And suffered and died alone</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">Chorus</p>
    <p>How marvelous! How wonderful!</p>
    <p>And my song shall ever be:</p>
    <p>How marvelous! How wonderful!</p>
    <p>Is my Savior’s love for me!</p>
    <br>
    <p>When with the ransomed in glory</p>
    <p>His face I at last shall see,</p>
    <p>‘T’will be my joy through the ages</p>
    <p>To sing of His love for me!</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">Chorus</p>
    <p>How marvelous! How wonderful!</p>
    <p>And my song shall ever be:</p>
    <p>How marvelous! How wonderful!</p>
    <p>Is my Savior’s love for me!</p>
