    <h3>'Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus</h3>

    <p>Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,</p>
    <p>Just to take him at his word</p>
    <p>Just to rest upon his promise,</p>
    <p>Just to know, "Thus saith the Lord."</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!</p>
    <p class="chorus">How I've proved him o'er and o'er!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!</p>
    <p class="chorus">O for grace to trust him more!</p>
    <br>
    <p>O how sweet to trust in Jesus,</p>
    <p>Just to trust his cleansing blood</p>
    <p>And in simple faith to plunge me</p>
    <p>'Neath the healing, cleansing flood!</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!</p>
    <p class="chorus">How I've proved him o'er and o'er!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!</p>
    <p class="chorus">O for grace to trust him more!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,</p>
    <p>Just from sin and self to cease;</p>
    <p>Just from Jesus simply taking</p>
    <p>Life and rest, and joy and peace</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!</p>
    <p class="chorus">How I've proved him o'er and o'er!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!</p>
    <p class="chorus">O for grace to trust him more!</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm so glad I learned to trust thee,</p>
    <p>Precious Jesus, Savior, friend,</p>
    <p>And I know that thou art with me,</p>
    <p>Wilt be with me to the end!</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!</p>
    <p class="chorus">How I've proved him o'er and o'er!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!</p>
    <p class="chorus">O for grace to trust him more!</p>
