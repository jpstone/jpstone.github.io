    <h3>Rejoice</h3>

    <p>Come and stand before your Maker</p>
    <p>Full of wonder, full of fear.</p>
    <p>Come behold His power and glory,</p>
    <p>Yet with confidence draw near.</p>
    <p>For the one who holds the heavens</p>
    <p>And commands the stars above</p>
    <p>Is the God who bends to bless us</p>
    <p>With an unrelenting love.</p>
    <br>
    <p>(Chorus)</p>
    <p>Rejoice! Come and lift your hands and</p>
    <p>Raise your voice, He is worthy of our praise,</p>
    <p>Rejoice! Sing of mercies of your King,</p>
    <p>And with trembling rejoice.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We are children of the promise,</p>
    <p>The beloved of the Lord,</p>
    <p>Won with everlasting kindness,</p>
    <p>Bought with sacrificial blood.</p>
    <p>Bringing reconciliation</p>
    <p>To a world that longs to know</p>
    <p>The affections of a Father</p>
    <p>Who will never let them go.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">(Chorus)</p>
    <br>
    <p>All our sickness, all our sorrows,</p>
    <p>Jesus carried up the hill.</p>
    <p>He has walked this path before us,</p>
    <p>He is walking with us still.</p>
    <p>Turning tragedy to triumph,</p>
    <p>Turning agony to praise;</p>
    <p>There is blessing in the battle,</p>
    <p>So take heart and stand amazed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Rejoice! When you cry to Him, He hears</p>
    <p>your voice. He will wipe away your tears;</p>
    <p>Rejoice! In the midst of suffering</p>
    <p>He will help you sing:</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">(Chorus)</p>
