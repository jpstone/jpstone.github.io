    <h3>Preserve Me, O God</h3>

    <p>1.Preserve me, O God, for I’m trusting in you.</p>
    <p>“Yes, you are my master,” I said to the LORD;</p>
    <p>besides you I do not possess any good.</p>
    <p>In your holy messengers I take delight.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2.Those running to idols will multiply griefs.</p>
    <p>I will not pour out their drink off’rings of blood,</p>
    <p>nor will I confess their vain names with my lips.</p>
    <p>The LORD’s my inherited portion and cup.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. You care for my lot,where the lines fell to me,</p>
    <p>my pleasant and lovely inherited land.</p>
    <p>The LORD who gives counsel to me I will bless,</p>
    <p>for surely my mind teaches me through the night.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4.The LORD ever present before me I keep.</p>
    <p>He stands at my right hand; I shall not be moved.</p>
    <p>My glory rejoices, my heart is made glad;</p>
    <p>and also my flesh will live safely at ease.</p>
    <br>
    <p>5.For you’ll not abandon my soul to the grave,</p>
    <p>your godly One you will preserve from decay.</p>
    <p>Life’s path you will show me; full joy is with you;</p>
    <p>your right hand holds pleasures for me evermore.</p>
