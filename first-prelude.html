    <h3>His Mercy is More</h3>

    <p>What love could remember no wrongs we have done</p>
    <p>Omniscient, all-knowing, He counts not their sum</p>
    <p>Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore</p>
    <p>Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more</p>
    <br>
    <p>What patience would wait as we constantly roam</p>
    <p>What Father, so tender, is calling us home</p>
    <p>He welcomes the weakest, the vilest, the poor</p>
    <p>Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more</p>
    <br>
    <p>Praise the Lord!</p>
    <p>His mercy is more</p>
    <p>Stronger than darkness, new every morn</p>
    <p>Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more</p>
    <br>
    <p>What riches of kindness He lavished on us</p>
    <p>His blood was the payment, His life was the cost</p>
    <p>We stood 'neath a debt we could never afford</p>
    <p>Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more</p>
    <br>
    <p>Praise the Lord!</p>
    <p>His mercy is more</p>
    <p>Stronger than darkness, new every morn</p>
    <p>Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more</p>
    <br>
    <p>Praise the Lord!</p>
    <p>His mercy is more</p>
    <p>Stronger than darkness, new every morn</p>
    <p>Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more</p>
