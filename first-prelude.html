    <h3>His Mercy is More</h3>

    <p>What love could remember</p>
    <p>no wrongs we have done!</p>
    <p>Omniscient, all knowing,</p>
    <p>he counts not their sum.</p>
    <p>Thrown into the sea</p>
    <p>without bottom or shore:</p>
    <p>Our sins they are many,</p>
    <p>his mercy is more.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What patience would wait</p>
    <p>as we constantly roam!</p>
    <p>What father so tender</p>
    <p>is calling us home.</p>
    <p>He welcomes the weakest</p>
    <p>the vilest the poor:</p>
    <p>Our sins they are many,</p>
    <p>his mercy is more.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">(Chorus)</p>
    <p>Praise the Lord!</p>
    <p>His mercy is more.</p>
    <p>Stronger than darkness,</p>
    <p>new every morn.</p>
    <p>Our sins they are many,</p>
    <p>his mercy is more.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What riches of kindness</p>
    <p>he lavished on us!</p>
    <p>His blood was the payment</p>
    <p>his life was the cost.</p>
    <p>We stood â€˜neath a debt</p>
    <p>we could never afford:</p>
    <p>Our sins they are many,</p>
    <p>his mercy is more.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">(Chorus)</p>
    <p>Praise the Lord!</p>
    <p>His mercy is more.</p>
    <p>Stronger than darkness,</p>
    <p>new every morn.</p>
    <p>Our sins they are many,</p>
    <p>his mercy is more.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Praise the Lord!</p>
    <p>His mercy is more.</p>
    <p>Stronger than darkness,</p>
    <p>new every morn.</p>
    <p>Our sins they are many,</p>
    <p>his mercy is more.</p>
