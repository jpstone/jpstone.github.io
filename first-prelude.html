    <h3>Jesus Paid it All</h3>

    <p>I hear the Savior say</p>
    <p>"Thy strength indeed is small;</p>
    <p>Child of weakness, watch and pray;</p>
    <p>Find in Me thine all in all."</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">Chorus</p>
    <br>
    <p>Jesus paid it all,</p>
    <p>All to Him I owe,</p>
    <p>Sin had left a crimson stain,</p>
    <p>He washed it white as snow!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Lord, now indeed I find</p>
    <p>Thy pow'r and Thine alone</p>
    <p>Can change the leper's spots</p>
    <p>And melt the heart of stone.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">Chorus</p>
    <br>
    <p>And when before the throne</p>
    <p>I stand in Him complete,</p>
    <p>“Jesus died my soul to save!”</p>
    <p>My lips shall still repeat.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">Chorus</p>
