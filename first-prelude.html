    <h3>What Child is This</h3>

    <p>What Child is this, who, laid to rest,</p>
    <p>On Mary's lap is sleeping?</p>
    <p>Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,</p>
    <p>While shepherds watch are keeping?</p>
    <p>This, this is Christ the King,</p>
    <p>Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:</p>
    <p>Haste, haste to bring Him laud,</p>
    <p>The babe, the son of Mary.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Why lies He in such mean estate</p>
    <p>Where ox and ass are feeding?</p>
    <p>Good Christian, fear; for sinners here</p>
    <p>The silent Word is pleading.</p>
    <p>Nails, spear, shall pierce Him through</p>
    <p>The cross be borne for me, for you;</p>
    <p>Hail, hail the Word made flesh:</p>
    <p>The babe, the son of Mary.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,</p>
    <p>Come, peasant, king, to own Him;</p>
    <p>The King of kings salvation brings,</p>
    <p>Let loving hearts enthrone Him.</p>
    <p>Raise, raise, the song on high,</p>
    <p>The virgin sings her lullaby;</p>
    <p>Joy, joy for Christ is born:</p>
    <p>The babe, the son of Mary!</p>
