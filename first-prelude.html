    <h3>Tis So Sweet To Trust In Jesus</h3>

    <p>Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,</p>
    <p>Just to take Him at His Word;</p>
    <p>Just to rest upon His promise,</p>
    <p>And to know, “Thus saith the Lord!”</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">(Chorus)</p>
    <p>Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!</p>
    <p>How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er;</p>
    <p>Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!</p>
    <p>Oh, for grace to trust Him more!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Oh, how sweet to trust in Jesus,</p>
    <p>Just to trust His cleansing blood;</p>
    <p>And in simple faith to plunge me</p>
    <p>’Neath the healing, cleansing flood!</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">(Chorus)</p>
    <p>Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!</p>
    <p>How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er;</p>
    <p>Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!</p>
    <p>Oh, for grace to trust Him more!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Yes, ’tis sweet to trust in Jesus,</p>
    <p>Just from sin and self to cease;</p>
    <p>Just from Jesus simply taking</p>
    <p>Life and rest, and joy and peace.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">(Chorus)</p>
    <p>Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!</p>
    <p>How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er;</p>
    <p>Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!</p>
    <p>Oh, for grace to trust Him more!</p>
    <br>
    <p>I’m so glad I learned to trust Thee,</p>
    <p>Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend;</p>
    <p>And I know that Thou art with me,</p>
    <p>Wilt be with me to the end.</p>
