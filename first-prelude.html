    <h3>My One Comfort</h3>

    <p>My one comfort both in life and death</p>
    <p>Is that I am not my own</p>
    <p>I was bought with blood and I confess</p>
    <p>I belong to you alone</p>
    <br>

    <p>By the Father’s good decree</p>
    <p>Jesus, you’ve delivered me</p>
    <p>By your Spirit set me free</p>
    <p>To follow you</p>
    <br>

    <p>(Repeat)</p>
