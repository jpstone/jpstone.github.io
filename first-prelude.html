    <h3>And Can it Be</h3>

    <p>And can it be that I should gain</p>
    <p>An int'rest in the Savior's blood?</p>
    <p>Died He for me, who caused His pain?</p>
    <p>For me, who Him to death pursued?</p>
    <p>Amazing love! How can it be</p>
    <p>That Thou, my God, should die for me?</p>
    <p>Amazing love! How can it be</p>
    <p>That Thou, my God, should die for me?</p>
    <br>
    <p>'Tis mystery all: thâ€™Immortal dies!</p>
    <p>Who can explore His strange design?</p>
    <p>In vain the firstborn seraph tries</p>
    <p>To sound the depths of love divine.</p>
    <p>'Tis mercy all! Let earth adore,</p>
    <p>Let angel minds inquire no more.</p>
    <p>Amazing love! How can it be</p>
    <p>That Thou, my God, should die for me?</p>
    <br>
    <p>He left his Father's throne above</p>
    <p>So free, so infinite his grace,</p>
    <p>Humbled himself so great his love,</p>
    <p>And bled for all his chosen race.</p>
    <p>'Tis mercy all, immense and free;</p>
    <p>For, O my God, it found out me.</p>
    <p>Amazing love! How can it be</p>
    <p>That Thou, my God, should die for me?</p>
    <br>
    <p>Long my imprisoned spirit lay</p>
    <p>Fast-bound in sin and nature's night;</p>
    <p>Thine eye diffused a quick'ning ray,</p>
    <p>I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;</p>
    <p>My chains fell off, my heart was free;</p>
    <p>I rose, went forth and followed Thee.</p>
    <p>Amazing love! How can it be</p>
    <p>That Thou, my God, should die for me?</p>
    <br>
    <p>No condemnation now I dread;</p>
    <p>Jesus, and all in Him is mine!</p>
    <p>Alive in Him, my living Head,</p>
    <p>And clothed in righteousness divine,</p>
    <p>Bold I approach the eternal throne,</p>
    <p>And claim the crown, through Christ my own.</p>
    <p>Amazing love! How can it be</p>
    <p>That Thou, my God, should die for me?</p>
