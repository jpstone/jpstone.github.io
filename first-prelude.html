    <h3>All People that on Earth do Dwell</h3>

    <p>1.All people that on earth do dwell,</p>
    <p>sing to the LORD with cheerful voice.</p>
    <p>Serve him with joy, his praises tell,</p>
    <p>come now before him and rejoice!</p>
    <br>
    <p>2.Know that the LORD is God indeed;</p>
    <p>he formed us all without our aid.</p>
    <p>We are the flock he surely feeds,</p>
    <p>the sheep who by his hand were made.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3.O enter then his gates with joy,</p>
    <p>within his courts his praise proclaim!</p>
    <p>Let thankful songs your tongues employ.</p>
    <p>O bless and magnify his name!</p>
    <br>
    <p>4.Because the LORD our God is good,</p>
    <p>his mercy is forever sure.</p>
    <p>His faithfulness at all times stood</p>
    <p>and shall from age to age endure.</p>
