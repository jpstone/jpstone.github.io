    <h3>Grace Alone</h3>

    <p>I was an orphan lost at the fall,</p>
    <p>running away when I’d hear you call</p>
    <p>but Father, you worked your will.</p>
    <p>I had no righteousness of my own.</p>
    <p>I had no right to draw near your throne</p>
    <p>but Father, you loved me still.</p>
    <br>
    <p>And in love before you laid the world’s foundation,</p>
    <p>you predestined to adopt me as your own.</p>
    <p>You have raised me up so high above my station.</p>
    <p>I’m a child of God by grace and grace alone.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You left your home to seek out the lost.</p>
    <p>You knew the great and terrible cost</p>
    <p>but Jesus, your face was set.</p>
    <p>I worked my fingers down to the bone.</p>
    <p>Nothing I did could ever atone</p>
    <p>but Jesus, you paid my debt.</p>
    <br>
    <p>By your blood I have redemption and salvation.</p>
    <p>Lord you died that I might reap what you have sown.</p>
    <p>And you rose that I might be a new creation.</p>
    <p>I am born again by grace and grace alone.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I was in darkness all of my life.</p>
    <p>I never knew the day from the night</p>
    <p>but Spirit, you made me see.</p>
    <p>I swore I knew the way on my own.</p>
    <p>Head full of rocks, a heart made of stone</p>
    <p>but Spirit, you moved in me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>At your touch my sleeping spirit was awakened.</p>
    <p>On my darkened heart, the light of Christ has shone.</p>
    <p>Called into a kingdom that cannot be shaken.</p>
    <p>Heaven’s citizen by grace and grace alone.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So I stand in faith by grace and grace alone.</p>
    <p>I will run the race by grace and grace alone.</p>
    <p>I will slay my sin by grace and grace alone.</p>
    <p>I will reach the end by grace and grace alone.</p>
