    <h3>Preserve Me, O God</h3>

    <p>Preserve me, O God, for I’m trusting in you.</p>
    <p>“Yes, you are my master,” I said to the Lord;</p>
    <p>Besides you I do not possess any good.</p>
    <p>In your holy messengers I take delight.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Those running to idols will multiply griefs.</p>
    <p>I will not pour out their drink off’rings of blood,</p>
    <p>Nor will I confess their vain names with my lips.</p>
    <p>The Lord’s my inherited portion and cup.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You care for my lot, where the lines fell to me,</p>
    <p>My pleasant and lovely inherited land.</p>
    <p>The Lord who gives counsel to me I will bless,</p>
    <p>For surely my mind teaches me through the night.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Lord ever present before me I keep.</p>
    <p>He stands at my right hand; I shall not be moved.</p>
    <p>My glory rejoices, my heart is made glad;</p>
    <p>And also my flesh will live safely at ease.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For you’ll not abandon my soul to the grave,</p>
    <p>Your godly One you will preserve from decay.</p>
    <p>Life’s path you will show me; full joy is with you;</p>
    <p>Your right hand holds pleasures for me evermore.</p>
