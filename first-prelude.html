    <h3>Come Behold the Wondrous Mystery</h3>

    <p>Come behold the wondrous mystery</p>
    <p>in the dawning of the King,</p>
    <p>He, the theme of heaven’s praises,</p>
    <p>robed in frail humanity.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In our longing, in our darkness,</p>
    <p>now the light of life has come;</p>
    <p>Look to Christ, who condescended,</p>
    <p>took on flesh to ransom us</p>
    <br>
    <p>Come behold the wondrous mystery:</p>
    <p>He the perfect Son of Man,</p>
    <p>In His living, in His suffering,</p>
    <p>never trace nor stain of sin</p>
    <br>
    <p>See the true and better Adam</p>
    <p>come to save the hell-bound man,</p>
    <p>Christ, the great and sure fulfillment</p>
    <p>of the law, in Him we stand.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Come behold the wondrous mystery:</p>
    <p>Christ the Lord upon the tree;</p>
    <p>In the stead of ruined sinners</p>
    <p>hangs the Lamb in victory.</p>
    <br>
    <p>See the price of our redemption;</p>
    <p>see the Father’s plan unfold,</p>
    <p>Bringing many sons to glory,</p>
    <p>grace unmeasured, love untold!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Come behold the wondrous mystery:</p>
    <p>slain by death, the God of life;</p>
    <p>But no grave could e’er restrain Him,</p>
    <p>praise the Lord, He is alive!</p>
    <br>
    <p>What a foretaste of deliverance;</p>
    <p>how unwavering our hope:</p>
    <p>Christ in power resurrected,</p>
    <p>as we will be when he comes.</p>
