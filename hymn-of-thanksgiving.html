    <h3>Bread of the World In Mercy Broken</h3>

    <p>Bread of the world in mercy broken,</p>
    <p>wine of the soul in mercy shed,</p>
    <p>by whom the words of life were spoken,</p>
    <p>and in whose death our sins are dead.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Look on the heart by sorrow broken,</p>
    <p>look on the tears by sinners shed;</p>
    <p>and be thy feast to us the token</p>
    <p>that by thy grace our souls are fed.</p>
