    <h3>Christ Shall HAve Dominion</h3>

    <p>Christ shall have dominion</p>
    <p>over land and sea,</p>
    <p>earth’s remotest regions</p>
    <p>shall his empire be;</p>
    <p>they that wilds inhabit</p>
    <p>shall their worship bring,</p>
    <p>kings shall render tribute,</p>
    <p>nations serve our King.</p>
    <p>Christ shall have dominion</p>
    <p>over land and sea,</p>
    <p>earth’s remotest regions</p>
    <p>shall his empire be.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When the needy seek him,</p>
    <p>he will mercy show;</p>
    <p>yea, the weak and helpless</p>
    <p>shall his pity know;</p>
    <p>he will surely save them</p>
    <p>from oppression’s might,</p>
    <p>for their lives are precious</p>
    <p>in his holy sight.</p>
    <p>Christ shall have dominion</p>
    <p>over land and sea,</p>
    <p>earth’s remotest regions</p>
    <p>shall his empire be.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Ever and forever</p>
    <p>shall his name endure;</p>
    <p>long as suns continue</p>
    <p>it shall stand secure;</p>
    <p>and in him forever</p>
    <p>all men shall be blest,</p>
    <p>and all nations hail him</p>
    <p>King of kings confessed.</p>
    <p>Christ shall have dominion</p>
    <p>over land and sea,</p>
    <p>earth’s remotest regions</p>
    <p>shall his empire be.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Unto God Almighty</p>
    <p>joyful Zion sings;</p>
    <p>he alone is glorious,</p>
    <p>doing wondrous things.</p>
    <p>Evermore, ye people,</p>
    <p>bless his glorious name,</p>
    <p>his eternal glory</p>
    <p>through the earth proclaim.</p>
    <p>Christ shall have dominion</p>
    <p>over land and sea,</p>
    <p>earth’s remotest regions</p>
    <p>shall his empire be.</p>
