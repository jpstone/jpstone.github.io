    <h3>From Depths of Woe I Raise to Thee</h3>

    <p>From depths of woe I raise to thee</p>
    <p>the voice of lamentation;</p>
    <p>Lord, turn a gracious ear to me</p>
    <p>and hear my supplication:</p>
    <p>if thou iniquities dost mark,</p>
    <p>our secret sins and misdeeds dark,</p>
    <p>O who shall stand before thee?</p>
    <br>
    <p>To wash away the crimson stain,</p>
    <p>grace, grace alone, availeth;</p>
    <p>our works, alas! are all in vain;</p>
    <p>in much the best life faileth:</p>
    <p>no man can glory in thy sight,</p>
    <p>all must alike confess thy might,</p>
    <p>and live alone by mercy.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Therefore my trust is in the Lord,</p>
    <p>and not in mine own merit;</p>
    <p>on him my soul shall rest, his Word</p>
    <p>upholds my fainting spirit:</p>
    <p>his promised mercy is my fort,</p>
    <p>my comfort, and my sweet support;</p>
    <p>I wait for it with patience.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What though I wait the livelong night,</p>
    <p>and ’til the dawn appeareth,</p>
    <p>my heart still trusteth in his might;</p>
    <p>it doubteth not nor feareth:</p>
    <p>do thus, O ye of Israel’s seed,</p>
    <p>ye of the Spirit born indeed;</p>
    <p>and wait ’til God appeareth.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Though great our sins and sore our woes,</p>
    <p>his grace much more aboundeth;</p>
    <p>his helping love no limitknows,</p>
    <p>our utmost need it soundeth.</p>
    <p>Our Shepherd good and true is he,</p>
    <p>who will at last his Israel free</p>
    <p>from all their sin and sorrow.</p>
