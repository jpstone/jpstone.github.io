    <h3>I Love the Lord, for He has Heard My Voice</h3>

    <p>I love the LORD, for he has heard my voice;</p>
    <p>he heard my pleas for mercy and for grace.</p>
    <p>Since he inclined his ear to my request,</p>
    <p>I’ll call on him as long as life shall last.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Anguish of death encompassed me about;</p>
    <p>cords of the grave and terror held me down.</p>
    <p>I was distressed.I called upon his name:</p>
    <p>“Rescue my soul, O LORD my God, I pray.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>Righteous and gracious is the LORD our God,</p>
    <p>rich in his mercy, tender in his love.</p>
    <p>He will preserve the simple in their need;</p>
    <p>when I was low, he came and rescued me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Rest, O my soul; the LORD has blessed you well,</p>
    <p>for you, O LORD, from death redeemed my soul.</p>
    <p>You dried my tears, my stumbling feet restored.</p>
    <p>I’ll walk the land of life before the LORD.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I spoke in anguish, though I still believed:</p>
    <p>“I’m greatly troubled by my pain and grief.”</p>
    <p>Filled with alarm, I said in my dismay,</p>
    <p>“All men speak lies, and falsehood is their way.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>What shall I render now unto the LORD</p>
    <p>for all his benefits on me bestowed?</p>
    <p>I’ll lift salvation’s cup, and with his saints</p>
    <p>I’ll pay my vows and call upon his name.</p>
    <br>
    <p>How dear to God the dying of his saints.</p>
    <p>LORD, I’m your servant; you have loosed my chains.</p>
    <p>I am your handmaid’s son, your servant true.</p>
    <p>I offer thankful sacrifice to you.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I call upon God’s name with thankful praise.</p>
    <p>’Mid all his people I will pay my vows,</p>
    <p>here, in the LORD’s house, in his temple courts,</p>
    <p>in you, Jerusalem. O praise the LORD!</p>
