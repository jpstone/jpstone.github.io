    <h3>Before the Throne of God Above</h3>

    <p>1. Before the throne of God above,</p>
    <p>I have a strong and perfect plea,</p>
    <p>a great High Priest whose name is Love,</p>
    <p>who ever lives and pleads for me.</p>
    <p>My name is graven on his hands,</p>
    <p>my name is written on his heart.</p>
    <p>I know that while in heavâ€™n he stands,</p>
    <p>no tongue can bid me thence depart,</p>
    <p>no tongue can bid me thence depart.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. When Satan tempts me to despair</p>
    <p>and tells me of the guilt within,</p>
    <p>upward I look and see him there,</p>
    <p>who made an end to all my sin.</p>
    <p>Because the sinless Savior died,</p>
    <p>my sinful soul is counted free;</p>
    <p>for God, the just, is satisfied</p>
    <p>to look on him and pardon me,</p>
    <p>to look on him and pardon me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. Behold him there, the risen Lamb,</p>
    <p>my perfect, spotless righteousness,</p>
    <p>the great unchangeable I AM,</p>
    <p>the King of glory and of grace!</p>
    <p>One with himself I cannot die.</p>
    <p>My soul is purchased by his blood!</p>
    <p>My life is hid with Christ on high,</p>
    <p>with Christ, my Savior and my God,</p>
    <p>with Christ, my Savior and my God.</p>
