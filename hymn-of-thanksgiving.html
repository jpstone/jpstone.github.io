    <h3>To God Be the Glory</h3>

    <p>To God be the glory, great things he has done!</p>
    <p>So loved he the world that he gave us his Son,</p>
    <p>who yielded his life an atonement for sin,</p>
    <p>and opened the life-gate that we may go in.</p>
    <p>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the earth hear his voice!</p>
    <p>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the people rejoice!</p>
    <p>O come to the Father thro’ Jesus the Son,</p>
    <p>and give him the glory, great things he has done!</p>
    <br>
    <p>O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood!</p>
    <p>To ev’ry believer the promise of God;</p>
    <p>the vilest offender who truly believes,</p>
    <p>that moment from Jesus forgiveness receives.</p>
    <p>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the earth hear his voice!</p>
    <p>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the people rejoice!</p>
    <p>O come to the Father thro’ Jesus the Son,</p>
    <p>and give him the glory, great things he has done!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Great things he has taught us, great things he has done,</p>
    <p>and great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;</p>
    <p>but purer and higher and greater will be</p>
    <p>our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.</p>
    <p>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the earth hear his voice!</p>
    <p>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,let the people rejoice!</p>
    <p>O come to the Father thro’ Jesus the Son,</p>
    <p>and give him the glory, great things he has done!</p>
