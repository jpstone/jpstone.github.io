    <h3>Blessed are the Sons of God</h3>

    <p>Blessed are the sons of God,</p>
    <p>they are bought with Christ’s own blood;</p>
    <p>they are ransomed from the grave,</p>
    <p>life eternal they shall have:</p>
    <p>With them numbered may we be,</p>
    <p>here and in eternity.</p>
    <br>
    <p>They are justified by grace,</p>
    <p>they enjoy the Savior’s peace;</p>
    <p>all their sins are washed away,</p>
    <p>they shall stand in God’s great day:</p>
    <p>With them numbered may we be,</p>
    <p>here and in eternity.</p>
    <br>
    <p>They are lights upon the earth,</p>
    <p>children of a heav’nly birth;</p>
    <p>one with God, with Jesus one,</p>
    <p>glory is in them begun:</p>
    <p>With them numbered may we be,</p>
    <p>here and in eternity.</p>
