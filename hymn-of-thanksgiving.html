    <h3>Now unto Jehova, Ye Sons of the Mighty</h3>

    <p>1. Now unto Jehovah,</p>
    <p>ye sons of the mighty,</p>
    <p>all glory and strength</p>
    <p>and dominion accord;</p>
    <p>ascribe to him glory,</p>
    <p>and render him honor.</p>
    <p>In beauty of holiness</p>
    <p>worship the Lord.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. The voice of Jehovah,</p>
    <p>the God of all glory,</p>
    <p>rolls over the waters,</p>
    <p>the thunders awake;</p>
    <p>the voice of Jehovah,</p>
    <p>majestic and mighty,</p>
    <p>is heard, and the cedars</p>
    <p>of Lebanon break.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. His voice makes the mountains</p>
    <p>and deserts to tremble,</p>
    <p>wild beasts are affrighted,</p>
    <p>the forests laid bare,</p>
    <p>and through all creation,</p>
    <p>his wonderful temple,</p>
    <p>all things he has fashioned</p>
    <p>his glory declare.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. The Lord ruled in might</p>
    <p>at the flood of great waters,</p>
    <p>a King whose dominion</p>
    <p>is never to cease;</p>
    <p>the Lord will give blessing</p>
    <p>and strength to his people,</p>
    <p>the Lord all his people</p>
    <p>will comfort with peace.</p>
