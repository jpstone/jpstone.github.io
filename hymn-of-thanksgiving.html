    <h3>Psalm 29-B</h3>

    <p>Now unto Jehovah, ye sons of the mighty,</p>
    <p>all glory and strength and dominion accord;</p>
    <p>ascribe to him glory, and render him honor.</p>
    <p>In beauty of holiness worship the Lord.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The voice of Jehovah, the God of all glory,</p>
    <p>rolls over the waters, the thunders awake;</p>
    <p>the voice of Jehovah, majestic and mighty,</p>
    <p>is heard, and the cedars of Lebanon break.</p>
    <br>
    <p>His voice makes the mountains and deserts to tremble,</p>
    <p>wild beasts are affrighted, the forests laid bare,</p>
    <p>and through all creation, his wonderful temple,</p>
    <p>all things he has fashioned his glory declare.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Lord ruled in might at the flood of great waters,</p>
    <p>a King whose dominion is never to cease;</p>
    <p>the Lord will give blessing and strength to his people,</p>
    <p>the Lord all his people will comfort with peace.</p>
