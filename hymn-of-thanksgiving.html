    <h3>Forgive Our Sins, as We Forgive</h3>

    <p>1. “Forgive our sins, as we forgive,”</p>
    <p>you taught us, Lord, to pray;</p>
    <p>but you alone can give us grace</p>
    <p>to live the words we say.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. How can your pardon reach and bless</p>
    <p>the unforgiving heart</p>
    <p>that broods on wrongs and will not let</p>
    <p>old bitterness depart?</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. In blazing light your cross reveals</p>
    <p>the truth we dimly know;</p>
    <p>how small the debts men owe to us;</p>
    <p>how great our debt to you.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. Lord, cleanse the depths within our souls,</p>
    <p>and bid resentment cease;</p>
    <p>then, reconciled to God and man,</p>
    <p>our lives will spread your peace.</p>
