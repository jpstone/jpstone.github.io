    <h3>LORD, from the Depths to You I Cry!</h3>

    <p>1.LORD, from the depths to you I cry!</p>
    <p>O Lord, to me give ear</p>
    <p>and give attention to my voice;</p>
    <p>my cry for mercy hear.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2.If you, O LORD, should mark our sins,</p>
    <p>then who, O Lord, could stand?</p>
    <p>But pardon can be found with you</p>
    <p>that you may fear command.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3.I wait, my soul awaits the LORD;</p>
    <p>my hope is in his word.</p>
    <p>Yes, more than watchmen wait for dawn,</p>
    <p>my soul awaits the Lord.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4.O Isr’el, hope in God the LORD,</p>
    <p>for mercy is with him;</p>
    <p>with great redemption he will save</p>
    <p>his Isr’el from all sin.</p>
