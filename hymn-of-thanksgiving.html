    <h3>Cast Down, O God, the Idols</h3>

    <p>1. Cast down, O God, the idols</p>
    <p>that hold us in their power,</p>
    <p>the empty gods we worship</p>
    <p>when darkness has its hour.</p>
    <p>We bow to other masters</p>
    <p>and by their promise live.</p>
    <p>Redeem our wayward passions;</p>
    <p>our rebel wills forgive.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. In vain we search for meaning</p>
    <p>where transient joys abound,</p>
    <p>and seek the soul’s contentment</p>
    <p>where peace cannot be found.</p>
    <p>We wander, lost and homeless,</p>
    <p>in endless, aimless quest,</p>
    <p>our hearts forever restless,</p>
    <p>until in you they rest.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. O God, we have our being</p>
    <p>in you and you alone.</p>
    <p>Recall us from our wand’rings;</p>
    <p>reclaim us as your own.</p>
    <p>Restore in us the image</p>
    <p>revealed in Christ, your Word,</p>
    <p>till heart and will pay homage</p>
    <p>to him, our God and Lord.</p>
