    <h3>How Deep the Father's Love for Us</h3>

    <p>How deep the Father’s love for us,</p>
    <p>how vast beyond all measure,</p>
    <p>that he should give his only Son</p>
    <p>to make a wretch his treasure.</p>
    <p>How great the pain of searing loss:</p>
    <p>the Father turns his face away</p>
    <p>as wounds which mar the Chosen One</p>
    <p>bring many sons to glory.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Behold the man upon a cross,</p>
    <p>my sin upon his shoulders;</p>
    <p>ashamed, I hear my mocking voice</p>
    <p>call out among the scoffers.</p>
    <p>It was my sin that held him there</p>
    <p>until it was accomplished;</p>
    <p>his dying breath has brought me life—</p>
    <p>I know that it is finished.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I will not boast in anything,</p>
    <p>no gifts, no pow’r, no wisdom;</p>
    <p>but I will boast in Jesus Christ,</p>
    <p>his death and resurrection.</p>
    <p>Why should I gain from his reward?</p>
    <p>I cannot give an answer,</p>
    <p>but this I know with all my heart:</p>
    <p>his wounds have paid my ransom.</p>
