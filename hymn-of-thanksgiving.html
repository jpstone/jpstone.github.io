    <h3>Father, Long Before Creation</h3>

    <p>Father, long before creation</p>
    <p>you had chosen us in love,</p>
    <p>and that love so deep, so moving,</p>
    <p>draws us close to Christ above.</p>
    <p>Still it keeps us firmly fixed in Christ alone.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Though the world may change its fashion,</p>
    <p>you will still remain the same;</p>
    <p>your compassion and your covâ€™nant</p>
    <p>through all ages will remain.</p>
    <p>Your own childrenshall forever praise your name.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Your compassion is our story,</p>
    <p>is our boasting all the day;</p>
    <p>mercy free and never failing</p>
    <p>moves our will, directs our way.</p>
    <p>God so loved us that he gave his only Son.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Loving Father, now before you</p>
    <p>we shall ever sing your grace,</p>
    <p>and our song will sound forever</p>
    <p>when we see you face to face,</p>
    <p>giving glory to the Lamb upon the throne.</p>
