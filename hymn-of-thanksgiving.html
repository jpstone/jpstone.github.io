    <h3>Before the Throne of God Above</h3>
    <br>
    <p>1. Before the throne of God above,
    <p>I have a strong and perfect plea,
    <p>a great High Priest whose name is Love,
    <p>who ever lives and pleads for me.
    <p>My name is graven on his hands,
    <p>my name is written on his heart.
    <p>I know that while in heavâ€™n he stands,
    <p>no tongue can bid me thence depart,
    <p>no tongue can bid me thence depart.
    <br>
    <p>2. When Satan tempts me to despair
    <p>and tells me of the guilt within,
    <p>upward I look and see him there,
    <p>who made an end to all my sin.
    <p>Because the sinless Savior died,
    <p>my sinful soul is counted free;
    <p>for God, the just, is satisfied
    <p>to look on him and pardon me,
    <p>to look on him and pardon me.
    <br>
    <p>3. Behold him there, the risen Lamb,
    <p>my perfect, spotless righteousness,
    <p>the great unchangeable I AM,
    <p>the King of glory and of grace!
    <p>One with himself I cannot die.
    <p>My soul is purchased by his blood!
    <p>My life is hid with Christ on high,
    <p>with Christ, my Savior and my God,
    <p>with Christ, my Savior and my God.
  </body>
