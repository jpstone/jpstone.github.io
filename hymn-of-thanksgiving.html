    <h3>Jesus Lives, and So Shall I</h3>

    <p>Jesus lives, and so shall I.</p>
    <p>Death! thy sting is gone forever!</p>
    <p>He who deigned for me to die,</p>
    <p>lives, the bands of death to sever.</p>
    <p>He shall raise me from the dust:</p>
    <p>Jesus is my hope and trust.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Jesus lives and reigns supreme;</p>
    <p>and, his kingdom still remaining,</p>
    <p>I shall also be with him,</p>
    <p>ever living, ever reigning.</p>
    <p>God has promised; be it must:</p>
    <p>Jesus is my hope and trust.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Jesus lives, and by his grace,</p>
    <p>vict’ry o’er my passions giving,</p>
    <p>I will cleanse my heart and ways,</p>
    <p>ever to his glory living.</p>
    <p>Me he raises from the dust:</p>
    <p>Jesus is my hope and trust.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Jesus lives! I know full well</p>
    <p>naught from him my heart can sever,</p>
    <p>life nor death nor pow’rs of hell,</p>
    <p>joy nor grief, henceforth forever.</p>
    <p>None of all his saints is lost:</p>
    <p>Jesus is my hope and trust.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Jesus lives, and death is now</p>
    <p>but my entrance into glory.</p>
    <p>Courage, then, my soul, for thou</p>
    <p>hast a crown of life before thee;</p>
    <p>thou shalt find thy hopes were just:</p>
    <p>Jesus is the Christian’s trust.</p>
