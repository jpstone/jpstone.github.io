    <h3>In Sweet Communion, Lord, With Thee</h3>

    <p>In sweet communion, Lord, with thee</p>
    <p>I constantly abide;</p>
    <p>my hand thou holdest in thine own</p>
    <p>to keep me near thy side.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thy counsel through my earthly way</p>
    <p>shall guide me and control,</p>
    <p>and then to glory afterward</p>
    <p>thou wilt receive my soul.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Whom have I, Lord, in heav’n but thee,</p>
    <p>to whom my thoughts aspire?</p>
    <p>And, having thee, on earth is naught</p>
    <p>that I can yet desire.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Though flesh and heart should faint and fail,</p>
    <p>the Lord will ever be</p>
    <p>the strength and portion of my heart,</p>
    <p>my God eternally.</p>
    <br>
    <p>To live apart from God is death,</p>
    <p>’tis good his face to seek;</p>
    <p>my refuge is the living God,</p>
