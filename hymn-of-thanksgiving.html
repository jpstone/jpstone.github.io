    <h3>A Mighty Fortress is Our God</h3>

    <p>1. A mighty fortress is our God,</p>
    <p>a bulwark never failing;</p>
    <p>our helper he, amid the flood</p>
    <p>of mortal ills prevailing.</p>
    <p>For still our ancient foe</p>
    <p>doth seek to work us woe;</p>
    <p>his craft and power are great,</p>
    <p>and armed with cruel hate,</p>
    <p>on earth is not his equal.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Did we in our own strength confide,</p>
    <p>our striving would be losing;</p>
    <p>were not the right man on our side,</p>
    <p>the man of God’s own choosing.</p>
    <p>Dost ask who that may be?</p>
    <p>Christ Jesus, it is he,</p>
    <p>Lord Sabaoth his name,</p>
    <p>from age to age the same,</p>
    <p>and he must win the battle.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. And though this world, with devils filled,</p>
    <p>should threaten to undo us,</p>
    <p>we will not fear, for God hath willed</p>
    <p>his truth to triumph through us.</p>
    <p>The prince of darkness grim,</p>
    <p>we tremble not for him;</p>
    <p>his rage we can endure,</p>
    <p>for lo, his doom is sure;</p>
    <p>one little word shall fell him.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. That Word above all earthly pow’rs,</p>
    <p>no thanks to them, abideth;</p>
    <p>the Spirit and the gifts are ours</p>
    <p>through him who with us sideth.</p>
    <p>Let goods and kindred go,</p>
    <p>this mortal life also;</p>
    <p>the body they may kill:</p>
    <p>God’s truth abideth still;</p>
    <p>his kingdom is forever.</p>
