    <h3>In Christ Alone</h3>

    <p>In Christ alone my hope is found,</p>
    <p>he is my light, my strength, my song;</p>
    <p>this cornerstone, this solid ground,</p>
    <p>firm through the fiercest drought and storm.</p>
    <p>What heights of love, what depths of peace,</p>
    <p>when fears are stilled, when strivings cease!</p>
    <p>My comforter, my all in all—</p>
    <p>here in the love of Christ I stand.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In Christ alone! Who took on flesh,</p>
    <p>fullness of God in helpless babe!</p>
    <p>This gift of love and righteousness,</p>
    <p>scorned by the ones he came to save.</p>
    <p>’Til on that cross as Jesus died,</p>
    <p>the wrath of God was satisfied;</p>
    <p>for ev’ry sin on him was laid—</p>
    <p>here in the death of Christ I live.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There in the ground his body lay,</p>
    <p>light of the world by darkness slain;</p>
    <p>then bursting forth in glorious day,</p>
    <p>up from the grave he rose again!</p>
    <p>And as he stands in victory,</p>
    <p>sin’s curse has lost its grip on me;</p>
    <p>for I am his and he is mine—</p>
    <p>bought with the precious blood of Christ.</p>
    <br>
    <p>No guilt in life, no fear in death:</p>
    <p>this is the pow’r of Christ in me.</p>
    <p>From life’s first cry to final breath,</p>
    <p>Jesus commands my destiny.</p>
    <p>No pow’r of hell, no scheme of man,</p>
    <p>can ever pluck me from his hand;</p>
    <p>’til he returns or calls me home—</p>
    <p>here in the pow’r of Christ I’ll stand.</p>
