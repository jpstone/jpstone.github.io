    <h3>Rejoice, the Lord is King</h3>

    <p>Rejoice, the Lord is King:</p>
    <p>your Lord and King adore!</p>
    <p>Rejoice, give thanks, and sing,</p>
    <p>and triumph evermore.</p>
    <p>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!</p>
    <p>Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Jesus the Savior reigns,</p>
    <p>the God of truth and love;</p>
    <p>when he had purged our stains,</p>
    <p>he took his seat above.</p>
    <p>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!</p>
    <p>Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!</p>
    <br>
    <p>His kingdom cannot fail,</p>
    <p>he rules o’er earth and heav’n;</p>
    <p>the keys ofdeath and hell</p>
    <p>are to our Jesus giv’n.</p>
    <p>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!</p>
    <p>Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!</p>
    <br>
    <p>He sits at God’s right hand</p>
    <p>’til all his foes submit,</p>
    <p>and bow to his command,</p>
    <p>and fall beneath his feet.</p>
    <p>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!</p>
    <p>Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Rejoice in glorious hope!</p>
    <p>Our Lord, the Judge, shall come,</p>
    <p>and take his servants up</p>
    <p>to their eternal home.</p>
    <p>Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!</p>
    <p>Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!</p>
