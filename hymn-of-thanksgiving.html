    <h3>All You that Fear Jehova's Name</h3>

    <p>All you that fear Jehovah’s name,</p>
    <p>his glory tell, his praise proclaim;</p>
    <p>you children of his chosen race,</p>
    <p>stand now in awe before his face,</p>
    <p>stand now in awe before his face.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The suff’ring One he has not spurned,</p>
    <p>who unto him for help has turned;</p>
    <p>from him he has not hid his face,</p>
    <p>but answered his request in grace,</p>
    <p>but answered his request in grace.</p>
    <br>
    <p>O Lord, your goodness makes me raise</p>
    <p>amid your people songs of praise;</p>
    <p>before all them that fear you, now</p>
    <p>I worship you and pay my vow,</p>
    <p>I worship you and pay my vow.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For all the meek you will provide,</p>
    <p>they shall be fed and satisfied;</p>
    <p>all they that seek the Lord shall live</p>
    <p>and never-ending praises give,</p>
    <p>and never-ending praises give.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Lord’s unfailing righteousness</p>
    <p>all generations shall confess;</p>
    <p>from age to age shall men be taught</p>
    <p>what wondrous works the Lord has wrought,</p>
    <p>what wondrous works the Lord has wrought.</p>
