    <h3>He Leadeth Me</h3>

    <p>He leadeth me: O blessed thought!</p>
    <p>O words with heav’nly comfort fraught!</p>
    <p>Whate’er I do, where’er I be,</p>
    <p>still ’tis God’s hand that leadeth me.</p>
    <p>He leadeth me, he leadeth me;</p>
    <p>by his own hand he leadeth me.</p>
    <p>His faithful foll’wer I would be,</p>
    <p>for by his hand he leadeth me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Sometimes ’mid scenes of deepest gloom,</p>
    <p>sometimes where Eden’s bowers bloom,</p>
    <p>by waters still, o’er troubled sea,</p>
    <p>still ’tis God’s hand that leadeth me.</p>
    <p>He leadeth me, he leadeth me;</p>
    <p>by his own hand he leadeth me.</p>
    <p>His faithful foll’wer I would be,</p>
    <p>for by his hand he leadeth me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Lord, I would clasp thy hand in mine,</p>
    <p>nor ever murmur nor repine,</p>
    <p>content, whatever lot I see,</p>
    <p>since ’tis my God that leadeth me.</p>
    <p>He leadeth me, he leadeth me;</p>
    <p>by his own hand he leadeth me.</p>
    <p>His faithful foll’wer I would be,</p>
    <p>for by his hand he leadeth me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>And when at last my race is run,</p>
    <p>the Savior’s work in me is done,</p>
    <p>e’en death’s cold wave I will not flee,</p>
    <p>since God through Jordan leadeth me.</p>
    <p>He leadeth me, he leadeth me;</p>
    <p>by his own hand he leadeth me.</p>
    <p>His faithful foll’wer I would be,</p>
    <p>for by his hand he leadeth me.</p>
