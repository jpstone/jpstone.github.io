    <h3>Now Israel May Say (Psalm 124)</h3>

    <p>1. Now Israel may say, and that in truth,</p>
    <p>if that the Lord had not our right maintained,</p>
    <p>if that the Lord had not with us remained,</p>
    <p>when cruel men against us rose to strive,</p>
    <p>we surely had been swallowed up alive.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Yea, when their wrath against us fiercely rose,</p>
    <p>the swelling tide had o’er us spread its wave,</p>
    <p>the raging stream had then become our grave,</p>
    <p>the surging flood, in proudly swelling roll,</p>
    <p>most surely then had overwhelmed our soul.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. Blest be the Lord, who made us not their prey;</p>
    <p>as from the snare a bird escapeth free,</p>
    <p>their net is rent and so escaped are we;</p>
    <p>our only help is in Jehovah’s name,</p>
    <p>who made the earth and all the heav’nly frame.</p>
