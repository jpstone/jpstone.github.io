    <h3>I Was Filled with Joy and Gladness</h3>

    <p>1.I was filled with joy and gladness</p>
    <p>when they said with one accord,</p>
    <p>“Let us make our pilgrim journey</p>
    <p>to the house of God the LORD.”</p>
    <p>O Jerus’lem, O Jerus’lem,</p>
    <p>we are standing in your gates;</p>
    <p>we are standing in your gates.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2.As a city bound together</p>
    <p>is Jerusalem designed.</p>
    <p>There, by law, the tribes ascending</p>
    <p>thank the LORD in praise combined.</p>
    <p>Thrones of David, thrones of David,</p>
    <p>there for royal justice stand;</p>
    <p>there for royal justice stand.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3.Pray for peace, the peace of Zion:</p>
    <p>“Prosper those who love you well!</p>
    <p>Peace be in your walls forever;</p>
    <p>safety in your towers dwell!”</p>
    <p>Peace and safety, peace and safety</p>
    <p>in Jerusalem abound;</p>
    <p>in Jerusalem abound.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4.For the sake of my companions,</p>
    <p>for my brothers, I will say:</p>
    <p>“May God’s peace abide within you!”</p>
    <p>For the temple’s sake I pray.</p>
    <p>For the LORD’s house, for the LORD’s house</p>
    <p>I will ever seek your good;</p>
    <p>I will ever seek your good.</p>
