    <h3>The LORD is My Shepherd</h3>

    <p>The LORD is my Shepherd; no want shall I know.</p>
    <p>He makes me lie down where the green pastures grow;</p>
    <p>he leads me to rest where the calm waters flow.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My wandering steps he brings back to his way,</p>
    <p>in straight paths of righteousness making me stay;</p>
    <p>and this he has done his great name to display.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Though I walk in death’s valley, where darkness is near,</p>
    <p>because you are with me, no evil I’ll fear;</p>
    <p>your rod and your staff bring me comfort and cheer.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In the sight of my en’mies a table you spread.</p>
    <p>The oil of rejoicing you pour on my head;</p>
    <p>my cup overflows and I’m graciously fed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So surely your covenant mercy and grace</p>
    <p>will follow me closely in all of my ways;</p>
    <p>I will dwell in the house of the LORD all my days.</p>
