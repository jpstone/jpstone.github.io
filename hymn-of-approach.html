    <h3>I Greet Thee, Who My Sure Redeemer Art</h3>

    <p>I greet thee, who my sure Redeemer art,</p>
    <p>my only trust and Savior of my heart,</p>
    <p>who pain didst undergo for my poor sake;</p>
    <p>I pray thee from our hearts all cares to take.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thou art the King of mercy and of grace,</p>
    <p>reigning omnipotent in ev’ry place:</p>
    <p>so come, O King, and our whole being sway;</p>
    <p>shine on us with the light of thy pure day.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thou art the Life, by which alone we live,</p>
    <p>and all our substance and our strength receive;</p>
    <p>O comfort us in death’s approaching hour,</p>
    <p>strong-hearted then to face it by thy pow’r.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thou hast the true and perfect gentleness,</p>
    <p>no harshness hast thou and no bitterness:</p>
    <p>make us to taste the sweet grace found in thee</p>
    <p>and ever stay in thy sweet unity.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our hope is in no other save in thee;</p>
    <p>our faith is built upon thy promise free;</p>
    <p>O grant to us such stronger hope and sure</p>
    <p>that we can boldly conquer and endure.</p>
