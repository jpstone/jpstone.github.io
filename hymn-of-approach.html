    <h3>Psalm 144-A vv. 1-4</h3>

    <p>Now blessed be the LORD,</p>
    <p>my rock of strength and might,</p>
    <p>who trains my hands for war,</p>
    <p>my fingers for the fight.</p>
    <p>My saving love and fort is he,</p>
    <p>my tow’r and shield to whom I flee,</p>
    <p>subduing peoples under me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>O LORD, what then is man,</p>
    <p>that you consider him—</p>
    <p>the son of man, that you</p>
    <p>should still remember him?</p>
    <p>Man’s life is like a breath of wind;</p>
    <p>his days are quickly at an end,</p>
    <p>as passing shadows soon are spent.</p>
    <br>
    <p>O LORD, divide your heav’ns,</p>
    <p>and come down from the skies!</p>
    <p>And touch the mountains high,</p>
    <p>that smoke from them might rise!</p>
    <p>Make lightning flash against your foe.</p>
    <p>Send out your arrows, let them go</p>
    <p>to rout and scatter them in woe.</p>
    <br>
    <p>From heaven stretch your hand;</p>
    <p>reach down to rescue me,</p>
    <p>and save me from the floods,</p>
    <p>from strangers set me free,</p>
    <p>whose mouths are full of empty lies,</p>
    <p>whose right hand falsehood will devise,</p>
    <p>a hand which falsely testifies.</p>
