    <h3>O Bless the LORD with All My Soul</h3>

    <p>O bless the LORD with all my soul,</p>
    <p>let all within me bless his name.</p>
    <p>Forget not all his benefits;</p>
    <p>O bless the LORD, my soul proclaim.</p>
    <p>The LORD forgives you all your sins,</p>
    <p>and heals your sickness and distress;</p>
    <p>your life he rescues from the grave,</p>
    <p>and you he crowns with tenderness.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Your deepest longings he fulfills</p>
    <p>from his unending stores of good,</p>
    <p>so, like the eagle’s strength in flight,</p>
    <p>your youthful vigor is renewed.</p>
    <p>The LORD performs his righteousness,</p>
    <p>and justice gives to suff’ring ones.</p>
    <p>To Moses he made known his ways,</p>
    <p>his mighty deeds to Isr’el’s sons.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The LORD is merciful and kind,</p>
    <p>to anger slow, and full of grace.</p>
    <p>He will not constantly reprove,</p>
    <p>or in his anger hide his face.</p>
    <p>He does not punish our misdeeds,</p>
    <p>or give our sins their just reward.</p>
    <p>How great his love—as high as heav’n—</p>
    <p>to all of those who fear the LORD!</p>
    <br>
    <p>As far as east is from the west,</p>
    <p>so far his love has borne away</p>
    <p>our many sins, iniquities,</p>
    <p>and all the guilt that on us lay.</p>
    <p>Just as a father loves his child,</p>
    <p>so God loves those who fear his name.</p>
    <p>For he remembers we are dust,</p>
    <p>and well he knows our feeble frame.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The days of man are like the grass,</p>
    <p>and as a meadow flow’r he grows.</p>
    <p>Its place will nevermore be known,</p>
    <p>as winds pass over, and it goes.</p>
    <p>But everlasting is God’s love</p>
    <p>to those who fear him, and their seed;</p>
    <p>his truth to those who cov’nant keep,</p>
    <p>and all his precepts fully heed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The LORD has set his throne in heav’n;</p>
    <p>his mighty kingdom rules o’er all.</p>
    <p>O you, his angels, bless the LORD,</p>
    <p>you mighty ones who do his will.</p>
    <p>O bless the LORD, you heav’nly hosts,</p>
    <p>all you who serve his holy word.</p>
    <p>Bless God, his works thro’out his realm,</p>
    <p>and you, my soul, O bless the LORD!</p>
