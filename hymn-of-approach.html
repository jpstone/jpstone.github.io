    <h3>Holy, Holy, Holy</h3>

    <p>1. Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
    <p>Early in the morning our song shall rise to thee.
    <p>Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty!
    <p>God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!
    <br>
    <p>2. Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore thee,
    <p>casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;
    <p>cherubim and seraphim falling down before thee,
    <p>who wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.
    <br>
    <p>3. Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide thee,
    <p>though the eye of sinful man thy glory may not see,
    <p>only thou art holy; there is none beside thee
    <p>perfect in powâ€™r, in love, and purity.
    <br>
    <p>4. Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
    <p>All thy works shall praise thy name in earth and sky and sea.
    <p>Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty!
    <p>God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!
