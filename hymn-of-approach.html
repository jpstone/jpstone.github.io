    <h3>Come, Ye Sinners, Poor and Needy</h3>

    <p>Come, ye sinners, poor and needy,</p>
    <p>weak and wounded, sick and sore;</p>
    <p>Jesus ready stands to save you,</p>
    <p>full of pity, love, and power.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Come, ye thirsty, come and welcome,</p>
    <p>God’s free bounty glorify;</p>
    <p>true belief and true repentance,</p>
    <p>ev’ry grace that brings you nigh.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Let not conscience make you linger,</p>
    <p>nor of fitness fondly dream;</p>
    <p>all the fitness he requireth</p>
    <p>is to feel your need of him.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Come, ye weary, heavy laden,</p>
    <p>lost and ruined by the fall;</p>
    <p>if you tarry till you’re better,</p>
    <p>you will never come at all.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I will rise and go to Jesus!</p>
    <p>He will save me from my sin.</p>
    <p>By the riches of his merit,</p>
    <p>there is joy and life in him.</p>
