    <h3>O Worship the King</h3>

    <p>O worship the King, all-glorious above,</p>
    <p>O gratefully sing his pow’r and his love;</p>
    <p>our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,</p>
    <p>pavilioned in splendor and girded with praise.</p>
    <br>
    <p>O tell of his might, O sing of his grace,</p>
    <p>whose robe is the light, whose canopy space.</p>
    <p>His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,</p>
    <p>and dark is his path on the wings of the storm.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The earth with its store of wonders untold,</p>
    <p>Almighty, your pow’r has founded of old;</p>
    <p>has ’stablished it fast by a changeless decree,</p>
    <p>and round it has cast, like a mantle, the sea.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Your bountiful care, what tongue can recite?</p>
    <p>It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;</p>
    <p>it streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,</p>
    <p>and sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,</p>
    <p>in you do we trust, nor find you to fail;</p>
    <p>your mercies how tender, how firm to the end,</p>
    <p>our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend!</p>
    <br>
    <p>O measureless Might! Ineffable Love!</p>
    <p>While angels delight to hymn you above,</p>
    <p>the humbler creation, though feeble their lays,</p>
    <p>with true adoration shall lisp to your praise.</p>
