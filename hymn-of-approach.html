    <h3>God Himself is With Us</h3>

    <p>God himself is with us:</p>
    <p>let us now adore him,</p>
    <p>and with awe appear before him.</p>
    <p>God is in his temple—</p>
    <p>all within keep silence,</p>
    <p>prostrate lie with deepest rev’rence.</p>
    <p>Him alone</p>
    <p>God we own,</p>
    <p>him, our God and Savior;</p>
    <p>praise his name forever.</p>
    <br>
    <p>God himself is with us:</p>
    <p>hear the harps resounding!</p>
    <p>See the crowds the throne surrounding!</p>
    <p>“Holy, holy, holy”—</p>
    <p>hear the hymn ascending,</p>
    <p>angels, saints, their voices blending!</p>
    <p>Bow thine ear</p>
    <p>to us here:</p>
    <p>hear, O Christ, the praises</p>
    <p>that thy church now raises.</p>
    <br>
    <p>O thou fount of blessing,</p>
    <p>purify my spirit;</p>
    <p>trusting only in thy merit,</p>
    <p>like the holy angels</p>
    <p>who behold thy glory,</p>
    <p>may I ceaselessly adore thee,</p>
    <p>and in all,</p>
    <p>great and small,</p>
    <p>seek to do most nearly</p>
    <p>what thou lovest dearly.</p>
