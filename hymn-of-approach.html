    <h3>Zion, to thy Savior Singing</h3>

    <p>Zion, to thy Savior singing,</p>
    <p>to thy Prince and Shepherd bringing</p>
    <p>sweetest hymns of love and praise,</p>
    <p>thou wilt never reach the measure</p>
    <p>of his worth, by all the treasure</p>
    <p>of thy most ecstatic lays.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Of all wonders that can thrill thee,</p>
    <p>and with adoration fill thee,</p>
    <p>what than this can greater be,</p>
    <p>that himself to thee he giveth?</p>
    <p>He that eateth ever liveth,</p>
    <p>for the Bread of Life is he.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Fill thy lips to overflowing</p>
    <p>with sweet praise, his mercy showing,</p>
    <p>who this heav’nly table spread:</p>
    <p>on this day so glad and holy,</p>
    <p>to each longing spirit lowly</p>
    <p>giveth he the living Bread.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here the King hath spread his table,</p>
    <p>whereon eyes of faith are able</p>
    <p>Christ our Passover to trace:</p>
    <p>shadows of the law are going,</p>
    <p>light and life and truth inflowing,</p>
    <p>night to day is giving place.</p>
    <br>
    <p>O Good Shepherd, Bread lifegiving,</p>
    <p>us, thy grace and life receiving,</p>
    <p>feed and shelter evermore;</p>
    <p>thou on earth our weakness guiding,</p>
    <p>we in heav’n with thee abiding</p>
    <p>with all saints will thee adore.</p>
