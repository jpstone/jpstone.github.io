    <h3>Crown Him With Many Crowns</h3>

    <p>Crown him with many crowns,</p>
    <p>the Lamb upon his throne;</p>
    <p>hark! how the heav’nly anthem drowns</p>
    <p>all music but its own:</p>
    <p>awake, my soul, and sing</p>
    <p>of him who died for thee,</p>
    <p>and hail him as thy matchless King</p>
    <p>through all eternity.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Crown him the Lord of life,</p>
    <p>triumphant o’er the grave,</p>
    <p>who rose victorious from the strife</p>
    <p>for those he came to save.</p>
    <p>His glories now we sing,</p>
    <p>who died and reigns on high;</p>
    <p>he died, eternal life to bring,</p>
    <p>and lives that death may die.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Crown him the Lord of love;</p>
    <p>behold his hands and side,</p>
    <p>rich wounds, yet visible above,</p>
    <p>in beauty glorified:</p>
    <p>no angel in the sky</p>
    <p>can fully bear that sight,</p>
    <p>but downward bends his burning eye</p>
    <p>at mysteries so bright.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Crown him the Lord of peace;</p>
    <p>whose pow’r a scepter sways</p>
    <p>from pole to pole, that wars may cease,</p>
    <p>absorbed in pray’r and praise:</p>
    <p>his reign shall know no end;</p>
    <p>and round his pierced feet</p>
    <p>fair flow’rs of paradise extend</p>
    <p>their fragrance ever sweet.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Crown him the Lord of years,</p>
    <p>the Potentate of time;</p>
    <p>Creator of the rolling spheres,</p>
    <p>ineffably sublime:</p>
    <p>all hail, Redeemer, hail!</p>
    <p>for thou hast died for me:</p>
    <p>thy praise shall never, never fail</p>
    <p>throughout eternity.</p>
