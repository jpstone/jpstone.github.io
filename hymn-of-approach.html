    <h3>Psalm 103-D</h3>

    <p>The tender love a father has</p>
    <p>for all his children dear,</p>
    <p>such love the Lord bestows on them</p>
    <p>who worship him in fear.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Lord remembers we are dust,</p>
    <p>and all our frailty knows;</p>
    <p>man’s days are like the tender grass,</p>
    <p>and as the flow’r he grows.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The flow’r is withered by the wind</p>
    <p>that smites with blighting breath;</p>
    <p>so man is quickly swept away</p>
    <p>before the blast of death.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Unchanging is the love of God,</p>
    <p>from age to age the same,</p>
    <p>displayed to all who do his will</p>
    <p>and reverence his name.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Those who his gracious cov’nant keep</p>
    <p>the Lord will ever bless;</p>
    <p>their children’s children shall rejoice</p>
    <p>to see his righteousness.</p>
