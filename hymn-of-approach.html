    <h3>Now Unto the LORD, All You Sons of the Mighty</h3>

    <p>Now unto the LORD, all you sons of the mighty,</p>
    <p>all glory and strength and dominion accord;</p>
    <p>ascribe to him glory, and render him honor.</p>
    <p>In beauty of holiness worship the LORD,</p>
    <p>in beauty of holiness worship the LORD.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The voice of the LORD is above all the waters;</p>
    <p>in thunder the God of all glory draws nigh.</p>
    <p>Lo, over the waves of the billowing waters</p>
    <p>the LORD is enthroned in his glory on high!</p>
    <p>The LORD is enthroned in his glory on high!</p>
    <br>
    <p>The voice of the LORD is almightyin power;</p>
    <p>the voice of the LORD in full majesty speaks:</p>
    <p>the voice of the LORD breaks the Lebanon cedars,</p>
    <p>and like a young calf he makes Lebanon skip,</p>
    <p>and like a young ox he makes Sirion leap.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The voice of the LORD strikes with flashes of lightning.</p>
    <p>The voice of the LORD shakes the deserts of earth!</p>
    <p>The LORD shakes the desert, the desert of Kadesh,</p>
    <p>the voice of the LORD makes the deer to give birth;</p>
    <p>the voice of the LORD strips the forests of earth.</p>
    <br>
    <p>And all in his temple, in worship, cry “Glory!”</p>
    <p>The LORD rules the flood and his reign shall ne’er cease.</p>
    <p>O may the LORD strengthen his people forever:</p>
    <p>O may the LORD bless all his people with peace!</p>
    <p>The LORD blesses all of his people with peace!</p>
