    <h3>O LORD, Our Lord, In All the Earth</h3>

    <p>O LORD, our Lord, in all the earth</p>
    <p>how excellent your name!</p>
    <p>For you have set above the heav’ns</p>
    <p>your glory and your fame.</p>
    <br>
    <p>From infants’ and from children’s lips</p>
    <p>you ordered praise to sound</p>
    <p>to silence all your enemies,</p>
    <p>the wicked to confound.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When I regard the heav’ns you made,</p>
    <p>your fingers’ work I trace;</p>
    <p>I see the moon and shining stars</p>
    <p>which you have set in place.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I ask myself, “What then is man</p>
    <p>that you should give him thought—</p>
    <p>the son of man, that you to him</p>
    <p>such gracious care have brought?”</p>
    <br>
    <p>You made him little less than those</p>
    <p>who dwell in heav’n above,</p>
    <p>and you have crowned and honored him</p>
    <p>with glory from above.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You made him ruler of the works</p>
    <p>created by your hand;</p>
    <p>you placed all things beneath his feet</p>
    <p>to be in his command:</p>
    <br>
    <p>All sheep and oxen, birds and fish,</p>
    <p>all beasts both wild and tame.</p>
    <p>O LORD, our Lord, in all the earth</p>
    <p>how excellent your name!</p>
