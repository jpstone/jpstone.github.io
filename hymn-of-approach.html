    <h3>Once in royal David's City</h3>

    <p>1. Once in royal David’s city</p>
    <p>stood a lowly cattle shed,</p>
    <p>where a mother laid her baby</p>
    <p>in a manger for his bed:</p>
    <p>Mary was that mother mild,</p>
    <p>Jesus Christ, her little child.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. He came down to earth from heaven</p>
    <p>who is God and Lord of all,</p>
    <p>and his shelter was a stable,</p>
    <p>and his cradle was a stall:</p>
    <p>with the poor, and mean, and lowly,</p>
    <p>lived on earth our Savior holy.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. And thro’ all his wondrous childhood</p>
    <p>he would honor and obey,</p>
    <p>love and watch the lowly maiden</p>
    <p>in whose gentle arms he lay:</p>
    <p>Christian children all must be</p>
    <p>mild,obedient, good as he.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. And our eyes at last shall see him,</p>
    <p>thro’ his own redeeming love;</p>
    <p>for that child so dear and gentle</p>
    <p>is our Lord in heav’n above:</p>
    <p>and he leads his children on</p>
    <p>to the place where he is gone.</p>
    <br>
    <p>5. Not in that poor lowly stable,</p>
    <p>with the oxen standing by,</p>
    <p>we shall see him, but in heaven,</p>
    <p>set at God’s right hand on high;</p>
    <p>when like stars his children crowned</p>
    <p>all in white shall wait around.</p>
