    <h3>Lord, To You I Lift My Soul</h3>

    <p>1.LORD, to you I lift my soul,</p>
    <p>O my God, I trust your name;</p>
    <p>let my foes not o’er me gloat;</p>
    <p>let me not be put to shame.</p>
    <p>Truly none who wait for you</p>
    <p>will be ever put to shame;</p>
    <p>those who wantonly betray,</p>
    <p>they will ever be ashamed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2.Make me know your ways, O LORD;</p>
    <p>in your path lead me in truth.</p>
    <p>You are God, my Savior true,</p>
    <p>all the day I wait for you.</p>
    <p>LORD, remember in your love</p>
    <p>all your mercies from of old.</p>
    <p>But remember not my sin,</p>
    <p>for your goodness’ sake, O LORD!</p>
    <br>
    <p>3.Good and upright is the LORD;</p>
    <p>he instructs all those who stray.</p>
    <p>All the meek he leads aright,</p>
    <p>he will teach his holy way.</p>
    <p>All his paths are steadfast love,</p>
    <p>he is faithful in his ways,</p>
    <p>for all those who keep his word</p>
    <p>and his covenant obey.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4.For the sake of your own name,</p>
    <p>LORD, forgive my guilt, tho’ great.</p>
    <p>Who is he who fears the LORD?</p>
    <p>God will teach him all his ways.</p>
    <p>In well-being he abides,</p>
    <p>and his seed receives the land.</p>
    <p>Those who fear the LORD he loves,</p>
    <p>makes them know his covenant.</p>
    <br>
    <p>5.To the LORD I turn my eyes;</p>
    <p>from all snares he plucks my feet.</p>
    <p>Show your grace and turn to me;</p>
    <p>I am lonely and afraid.</p>
    <p>All my troubles are enlarged,</p>
    <p>give relief from my distress.</p>
    <p>See my deep afflictions, LORD,</p>
    <p>and forgive my sinfulness.</p>
    <br>
    <p>6. See how many are my foes,</p>
    <p>see the vi’lence of their hate.</p>
    <p>Guard my soul! Deliver me!</p>
    <p>Let me not be put to shame,</p>
    <p>since I wait for you, O LORD.</p>
    <p>May my uprightness prevail.</p>
    <p>From his troubles, gracious God,</p>
    <p>O redeem your Israel.</p>
