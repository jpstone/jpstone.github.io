    <h3>O Christ, Our King, Creator, Lord</h3>

    <p>O Christ, our King, Creator, Lord,</p>
    <p>Savior of all who trust thy Word,</p>
    <p>to them who seek thee ever near,</p>
    <p>now to our praises bend thine ear.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In thy dear cross a grace is found</p>
    <p>(it flows from ev’ry streaming wound)</p>
    <p>whose pow’r our inbred sin controls,</p>
    <p>breaks the firm bond, and frees our souls.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thou didst create the stars of night;</p>
    <p>yet thou hast veiled in flesh thy light,</p>
    <p>hast deigned a mortal form to wear,</p>
    <p>a mortal’s painful lot to bear.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When thou didst hang upon the tree,</p>
    <p>the quaking earth acknowledged thee;</p>
    <p>when thou didst there yield up thy breath,</p>
    <p>the world grew dark as shades of death.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now in the Father’s glory high,</p>
    <p>great Conqu’ror, nevermore to die,</p>
    <p>us by thy mighty pow’r defend,</p>
    <p>and reign through ages without end.</p>
