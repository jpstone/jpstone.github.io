    <h3>Psalm 47-A</h3>

    <p>O clap your hands, all peoples shout!</p>
    <p>Let joyful cries to God ring out!</p>
    <p>The LORD Most High is greatly feared,</p>
    <p>great King who rules the earth throughout!</p>
    <br>
    <p>He brought the nations ’neath our feet,</p>
    <p>subdued the peoples under us.</p>
    <p>He chose for us our heritage,</p>
    <p>the pride of Jacob whom he loves.</p>
    <br>
    <p>God has gone up with shouts of joy,</p>
    <p>the LORD amid the trumpet sound.</p>
    <p>Sing praise, sing praise to God Most High;</p>
    <p>to God our King let praise abound.</p>
    <br>
    <p>God is the King of all the earth;</p>
    <p>sing psalms of praise to him alone.</p>
    <p>God rules the nations from on high;</p>
    <p>he sits upon his holy throne.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Leaders of nations gather round</p>
    <p>to serve as sons of Abrah’m’s God.</p>
    <p>To him belong the shields of earth;</p>
    <p>exalted greatly is the LORD!</p>
