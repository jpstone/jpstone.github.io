    <h3>Psalm 2-B</h3>

    <p>1. Why do heathen nations rage?</p>
    <p>Why do peoples plot in vain?</p>
    <p>Kings and rulers join to wage</p>
    <p>war against God’s royal reign.</p>
    <p>Speaking out against the LORD,</p>
    <p>his Anointed they defy:</p>
    <p>“Let us break apart their cords,</p>
    <p>cast away their chains,” they cry.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. He who sits in heaven laughs;</p>
    <p>God derides and mocks them all.</p>
    <p>Then he speaks to them in wrath,</p>
    <p>fear and dread on them do fall:</p>
    <p>“Yet according to my will,</p>
    <p>I have set my king to reign,</p>
    <p>fixed on Zion’s holy hill,</p>
    <p>my Anointed will remain.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. I will tell of his decree:</p>
    <p>this to me the LORD did say,</p>
    <p>“You are my beloved Son;</p>
    <p>I have brought you forth this day.</p>
    <p>Ask for all the earth abroad,</p>
    <p>you shall own the nations far.</p>
    <p>You will break them with a rod,</p>
    <p>dash them like a potter’s jar.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. Therefore, kings, be wise, be warned;</p>
    <p>rulers of the earth, give ear.</p>
    <p>Come with awe and serve the LORD:</p>
    <p>mingle joy with trembling fear.</p>
    <p>Kiss the Son, his anger turn,</p>
    <p>lest you perish in the way,</p>
    <p>for his wrath will quickly burn.</p>
    <p>All who trust him—blest are they!</p>
