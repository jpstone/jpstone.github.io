    <h3>By Flowing Streams in Babylon</h3>

    <p>1.By flowing streams in Babylon,</p>
    <p>when we remembered Zion there,</p>
    <p>we sat down and we wept in grief;</p>
    <p>on willows there we hung our lyres.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2.For there our captors called for songs,</p>
    <p>our cruel tormentors asked for mirth.</p>
    <p>They called for us to sing to them:</p>
    <p>“Come, sing us one of Zion’s songs!”</p>
    <br>
    <p>3.But how can we the LORD’s song sing,</p>
    <p>when we are in a foreign land?</p>
    <p>If I forget Jerusalem,</p>
    <p>let my right hand forget its skill!</p>
    <br>
    <p>4.O let my tongue to my palate cleave</p>
    <p>if I do not remember you,</p>
    <p>if I set not Jerusalem</p>
    <p>above my greatest, highest joy.</p>
    <br>
    <p>5.Remember Edom’s sons, O LORD,</p>
    <p>who uttered in Jerus’lem’s day,</p>
    <p>“O lay it bare, O lay it bare!</p>
    <p>Destroy down to the ground its base.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>6. O Babel’s daughter, doomed to die,</p>
    <p>blest be the one repaying you.</p>
    <p>Blest he who takes your little ones</p>
    <p>and dashes them against the rock!</p>
