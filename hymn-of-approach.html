    <h3>Jerusalem the Golden</h3>

    <p>Jerusalem the golden,</p>
    <p>with milk and honey blest,</p>
    <p>beneath your contemplation</p>
    <p>sink heart and voice oppressed.</p>
    <p>I know not, O I know not,</p>
    <p>what joys await us there;</p>
    <p>what radiancy of glory,</p>
    <p>what bliss beyond compare.</p>
    <br>
    <p>They stand, those halls of Zion,</p>
    <p>all jubilant with song,</p>
    <p>and bright with many an angel,</p>
    <p>and all the martyr throng.</p>
    <p>The Prince is ever in them,</p>
    <p>the daylight is serene;</p>
    <p>the pastures of the blessed</p>
    <p>are decked in glorious sheen.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There is the throne of David;</p>
    <p>and there, from care released,</p>
    <p>the song of them that triumph,</p>
    <p>the shout of them that feast;</p>
    <p>and they who with their Leader</p>
    <p>have conquered in the fight,</p>
    <p>forever and forever</p>
    <p>are clad in robes of white.</p>
    <br>
    <p>O sweet and blessed country,</p>
    <p>the home of Godâ€™s elect!</p>
    <p>O sweet and blessed country</p>
    <p>that eager hearts expect!</p>
    <p>Jesus, in mercy bring us</p>
    <p>to that dear land of rest;</p>
    <p>who are, with God the Father</p>
    <p>and Spirit, ever blest.</p>
