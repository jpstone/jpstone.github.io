    <h3>More Than Conquerors</h3>

    <p>All hail the mighty Conqueror,</p>
    <p>Christ Jesus, our great King!</p>
    <p>All hail the glorious Warrior,</p>
    <p>to whom our praise we bring.</p>
    <p>May he be given honors</p>
    <p>by all his ransomed host:</p>
    <p>we, too, are more than conquerors</p>
    <p>who make his name our boast.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Yet how can we inherit</p>
    <p>this title “conqueror” too?</p>
    <p>We have not earned the merit</p>
    <p>or fame that is his due.</p>
    <p>For we have only failed him</p>
    <p>by ev’ry sin and doubt;</p>
    <p>indeed, we cruelly nailed him</p>
    <p>and cast the Conqueror out.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But rising up victorious</p>
    <p>he conquered death and sin,</p>
    <p>and reigns in heaven glorious,</p>
    <p>each conflict set to win.</p>
    <p>To those of his own choosing</p>
    <p>he shares the victory;</p>
    <p>says, “Though you once were losing,</p>
    <p>come conquer now through me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>“You cannot be defeated</p>
    <p>by trials in this life.</p>
    <p>The conquest is completed</p>
    <p>o’er Satan, sin, and strife.</p>
    <p>No pain, no tribulation,</p>
    <p>no danger, famine, sword,</p>
    <p>no—nothing in creation</p>
    <p>can conquer those in God.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now since our God is for us,</p>
    <p>what have we then to fear?</p>
    <p>Though enemies deplore us,</p>
    <p>we face them all with cheer.</p>
    <p>For we will be triumphant:</p>
    <p>each foe will be trod down</p>
    <p>beneath the Christ exultant,</p>
    <p>who shares the Conqueror’s crown.</p>
