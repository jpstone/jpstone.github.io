    <h3>To Us a Child of Hope is Born</h3>

    <p>1. To us a child of hope is born,</p>
    <p>to us a son is giv’n,</p>
    <p>him shall the tribes of earth obey,</p>
    <p>him all the hosts of heav’n.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. His name shall be the Prince of Peace,</p>
    <p>forevermore adored,</p>
    <p>the Wonderful, the Counselor,</p>
    <p>the great and mighty Lord.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. His pow’r, increasing, still shall spread,</p>
    <p>his reign no end shall know;</p>
    <p>justice shall guard his throne above,</p>
    <p>and peace abound below.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. To us a child of hope is born,</p>
    <p>to us a son is giv’n,</p>
    <p>the Wonderful, the Counselor,</p>
    <p>the mighty Lord of heav’n.</p>
