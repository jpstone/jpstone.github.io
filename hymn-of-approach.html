    <h3>Eternal is Your Word, O LORD</h3>

    <p>1.Eternal is your word, O LORD;</p>
    <p>in heav’n it stands forever sure.</p>
    <p>Your truth remains thro’ ev’ry age</p>
    <p>the earth you founded, it endures.</p>
    <p>They stand by your decree this day,</p>
    <p>for all things serve your sov’reign way.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2.Had not your law been my delight,</p>
    <p>I would have perished in my strife.</p>
    <p>Your precepts I will not forget;</p>
    <p>for thro’ them you preserved my life.</p>
    <p>LORD, rescue me, for I am yours,</p>
    <p>and I have sought to know your word.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3.The wicked lie in wait for me;</p>
    <p>destruction threatens at their hands,</p>
    <p>but I, in spite of all their threats,</p>
    <p>will still consider your commands.</p>
    <p>Perfection’s limits I have found,</p>
    <p>but your commandments have no bound.</p>
