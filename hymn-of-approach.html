    <h3>Come, thou Long-Expected Jesus</h3>

    <p>1. Come, thou long-expected Jesus,</p>
    <p>born to set thy people free;</p>
    <p>from our fears and sins release us;</p>
    <p>let us find our rest in thee.</p>
    <p>Israel’s strength and consolation,</p>
    <p>hope of all the earth thou art,</p>
    <p>dear Desire of ev’ry nation,</p>
    <p>joy of ev’ry longing heart.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Joy to those who long to see thee,</p>
    <p>Dayspring from on high, appear;</p>
    <p>come, thou promised Rod of Jesse,</p>
    <p>of thy birth we long to hear!</p>
    <p>O’er the hills the angels singing</p>
    <p>news, glad tidings of a birth:</p>
    <p>“Go to him, your praises bringing;</p>
    <p>Christ the Lord has come to earth.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. Come to earth to taste our sadness,</p>
    <p>he whose glories knew no end;</p>
    <p>by his life he brings us gladness,</p>
    <p>our Redeemer, Shepherd, Friend.</p>
    <p>Leaving riches without number,</p>
    <p>born within a cattle stall;</p>
    <p>this the everlasting wonder,</p>
    <p>Christ was born the Lord of all.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. Born thy people to deliver,</p>
    <p>born a child and yet a king,</p>
    <p>born to reign in us forever,</p>
    <p>now thy gracious kingdom bring.</p>
    <p>By thine own eternal Spirit</p>
    <p>rule in all our hearts alone;</p>
    <p>by thine all-sufficient merit,</p>
    <p>raise us to thy glorious throne.</p>
