    <h3>Psalm 9-B</h3>

    <p>Wholehearted thanksgiving to thee will I bring,</p>
    <p>in praise of thy marvelous deeds I will sing;</p>
    <p>in thee I will joy and exultingly cry,</p>
    <p>thy name I will praise, O Jehovah Most High.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">Refrain:</p>
    <p class="chorus">Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,</p>
    <p class="chorus">let the earth hear his voice!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,</p>
    <p class="chorus">let the people rejoice!</p>
    <p class="chorus">O come to Jehovah, declare ye his fame,</p>
    <p class="chorus">and give him all honor, for just is his name.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thou, Lord, art a refuge for all the oppressed;</p>
    <p>all trust thee who know thee, and trusting are blest;</p>
    <p>for never, O Lord, did thy mercy forsake</p>
    <p>the soul that has sought of thy grace to partake.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">Refrain:</p>
    <p class="chorus">Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,</p>
    <p class="chorus">let the earth hear his voice!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,</p>
    <p class="chorus">let the people rejoice!</p>
    <p class="chorus">O come to Jehovah, declare ye his fame,</p>
    <p class="chorus">and give him all honor, for just is his name.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Give praise to Jehovah, the mighty deeds tell</p>
    <p>of him who has chosen in Zion to dwell,</p>
    <p>of him to whom justice and vengeance belong,</p>
    <p>who visits the lowly and overthrows wrong.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">Refrain:</p>
    <p class="chorus">Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,</p>
    <p class="chorus">let the earth hear his voice!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,</p>
    <p class="chorus">let the people rejoice!</p>
    <p class="chorus">O come to Jehovah, declare ye his fame,</p>
    <p class="chorus">and give him all honor, for just is his name.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Behold my affliction, thy mercy accord,</p>
    <p>and back from deathâ€™s portals restore me, O Lord,</p>
    <p>that I in the gates of thy Zion may raise</p>
    <p>my song of salvation and show forth thy praise.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="chorus">Refrain:</p>
    <p class="chorus">Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,</p>
    <p class="chorus">let the earth hear his voice!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,</p>
    <p class="chorus">let the people rejoice!</p>
    <p class="chorus">O come to Jehovah, declare ye his fame,</p>
    <p class="chorus">and give him all honor, for just is his name.</p>
