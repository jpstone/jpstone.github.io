    <h3>The LORD's My Light</h3>

    <p>The LORD’s my light and saving help—</p>
    <p>by whom am I dismayed?</p>
    <p>The LORD’s the stronghold of my life—</p>
    <p>of whom am I afraid?</p>
    <p>When evildoers threaten me</p>
    <p>to eat my flesh away,</p>
    <p>my adversaries and my foes</p>
    <p>will stumble in that day.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Though armies war on ev’ry side,</p>
    <p>my heart will feel no dread;</p>
    <p>though war against me should arise,</p>
    <p>yet I will lift my head.</p>
    <p>One thing I plead before the LORD,</p>
    <p>and seek with heart upraised:</p>
    <p>that I may come within God’s house</p>
    <p>and dwell there all my days—</p>
    <br>
    <p>to gaze upon the beauty of</p>
    <p>the LORD and see his grace,</p>
    <p>and seek to know, within his house,</p>
    <p>instruction in his ways.</p>
    <p>For he will hide and shelter me</p>
    <p>when comes the evil day;</p>
    <p>he sets me high upon a rock;</p>
    <p>his tent will keep me safe.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My head is lifted high above</p>
    <p>my foes who hem me in;</p>
    <p>I sacrifice within his tent;</p>
    <p>with shouts of joy I sing.</p>
    <p>LORD, hear me when I call to you;</p>
    <p>be merciful and speak!</p>
    <p>“Come, seek my face!” you told my heart;</p>
    <p>your face, LORD, will I seek.</p>
    <br>
    <p>O do not hide your face from me,</p>
    <p>and do not turn aside</p>
    <p>your servant in your righteous wrath,</p>
    <p>for you have been my guide.</p>
    <p>O God, my Savior, leave me not;</p>
    <p>do not reject my plea.</p>
    <p>My parents may forsake me, LORD,</p>
    <p>but you will welcome me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>O teach your way and lead me, LORD,</p>
    <p>against my enemies.</p>
    <p>To false and cruel witnesses</p>
    <p>do not deliver me.</p>
    <p>Yet I am sure that in this life</p>
    <p>God’s goodness I will see.</p>
    <p>Await the LORD; be strong, take heart.</p>
    <p>For him wait patiently.</p>
