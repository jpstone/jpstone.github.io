    <h3>O Day of Rest and Gladness</h3>

    <p>1. O day of rest and gladness,</p>
    <p>O day of joy and light,</p>
    <p>O balm of care and sadness,</p>
    <p>most beautiful, most bright;</p>
    <p>on thee the high and lowly</p>
    <p>through ages joined in tune,</p>
    <p>sing, “Holy, holy, holy”</p>
    <p>to the great God Triune.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. On thee, at the creation,</p>
    <p>the light first had its birth;</p>
    <p>on thee, for our salvation,</p>
    <p>Christ rose from depths of earth;</p>
    <p>on thee, our Lord victorious,</p>
    <p>the Spirit sent from heav’n;</p>
    <p>and thus on thee, most glorious,</p>
    <p>a triple light was giv’n.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. Today on weary nations</p>
    <p>the heav’nly manna falls;</p>
    <p>to holy convocations</p>
    <p>the silver trumpet calls,</p>
    <p>where gospel light is glowing</p>
    <p>with pure and radiant beams,</p>
    <p>and living water flowing</p>
    <p>with soul-refreshing streams.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. New graces ever gaining</p>
    <p>from this our day of rest,</p>
    <p>we reach the rest remaining</p>
    <p>to spirits of the blest.</p>
    <p>To Holy Ghost be praises,</p>
    <p>to Father, and to Son;</p>
    <p>the church her voice upraises</p>
    <p>to thee, blest Three in One.</p>
