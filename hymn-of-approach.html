    <h3>Shout to the LORD, All Earth</h3>

    <p>Shout to the LORD, all earth,</p>
    <p>and make a joyful noise!</p>
    <p>With gladness serve the LORD your God;</p>
    <p>before him lift your voice!</p>
    <p>Now know the LORD is God.</p>
    <p>He made us, we are hisâ€”</p>
    <p>his people and his sheep, who safely</p>
    <p>in his pasture graze.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Enter his gates with thanks,</p>
    <p>and fill his courts with praise.</p>
    <p>Give thanks to him, and bless his name;</p>
    <p>to God your voices raise.</p>
    <p>Because the LORD is good,</p>
    <p>his steadfast love endures;</p>
    <p>from age to age, forevermore,</p>
    <p>his faithfulness is sure.</p>
