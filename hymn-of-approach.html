    <h3>I Love You, Lord, My Strength</h3>

    <p>1. I love you, LORD, my strength, my rock.</p>
    <p>He is my fort, my saving pow’r;</p>
    <p>God is my shield, my shelt’ring rock,</p>
    <p>my horn of safety, mighty tow’r.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. I call to God the LORD on high;</p>
    <p>worthy is he of all my praise.</p>
    <p>He hears my cry and sets me free</p>
    <p>from all my foes; in might he saves.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. Grim cords of death encompassed me;</p>
    <p>waves of destruction frightened me.</p>
    <p>Cords of the grave surrounded me,</p>
    <p>terrors of death confronted me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. In my distress I sought the LORD;</p>
    <p>I cried for help to God who hears.</p>
    <p>He from his temple heard my voice;</p>
    <p>he let my pleading reach his ears.</p>
    <br>
    <p>5. He from on high took hold of me;</p>
    <p>he pulled me up from waters deep.</p>
    <p>He saved me from my enemy,</p>
    <p>haters who were too strong for me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>6. In my distress they threatened me,</p>
    <p>but God sustained me in my plight.</p>
    <p>He brought me out to freedom’s land,</p>
    <p>for in my life he took delight.</p>
    <br>
    <p>7. God has repaid my righteousness;</p>
    <p>he favored me accordingly.</p>
    <p>He saw the cleanness of my hands;</p>
    <p>he has in grace rewarded me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>8. You save the humble and the meek,</p>
    <p>but shame the haughty eyes of pride.</p>
    <p>You, LORD, will keep my lamp aflame;</p>
    <p>God turns my darkness into light.</p>
