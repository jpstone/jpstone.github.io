    <h3>Look, Ye Saints, the Sight is Glorious</h3>

    <p>1. Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious:</p>
    <p>see the Man of Sorrows now;</p>
    <p>from the fight returned victorious,</p>
    <p>ev’ry knee to him shall bow.</p>
    <p>Crown him! Crown him!</p>
    <p>Crowns become the Victor’s brow.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Crown the Savior, angels, crown him;</p>
    <p>rich the trophies Jesus brings;</p>
    <p>in the seat of pow’r enthrone him,</p>
    <p>while the vault of heaven rings.</p>
    <p>Crown him! Crown him!</p>
    <p>Crown the Savior King of kings.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. Sinners in derision crowned him,</p>
    <p>mocking thus the Savior’s claim;</p>
    <p>saints and angels crowd around him,</p>
    <p>own his title, praise his name.</p>
    <p>Crown him! Crown him!</p>
    <p>Spread abroad the Victor’s fame!</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. Hark! those bursts of acclamation!</p>
    <p>Hark! those loud triumphant chords!</p>
    <p>Jesus takes the highest station;</p>
    <p>O what joy the sight affords!</p>
    <p>Crown him! Crown him!</p>
    <p>King of kings and Lord of lords.</p>
