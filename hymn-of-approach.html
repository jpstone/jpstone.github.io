    <h3>We Come, O Christ, to You</h3>

    <p>We come, O Christ, to you,</p>
    <p>true Son of God and man,</p>
    <p>by whom all things consist,</p>
    <p>in whom all life began:</p>
    <p>in you alone we live and move,</p>
    <p>and have our being in your love.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You are the Way to God,</p>
    <p>your blood our ransom paid;</p>
    <p>in you we face our Judge</p>
    <p>and Maker unafraid.</p>
    <p>Before the throne absolved we stand,</p>
    <p>your love has met your law’s demand.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You are the living Truth!</p>
    <p>All wisdom dwells in you,</p>
    <p>the Source of ev’ry skill,</p>
    <p>the one eternal True!</p>
    <p>O great I AM! In you we rest,</p>
    <p>sure answer to our ev’ry quest.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You only are true Life,</p>
    <p>to know you is to live</p>
    <p>the more abundant life</p>
    <p>that earth can never give:</p>
    <p>O risen Lord! We live in you:</p>
    <p>in us each day your life renew!</p>
    <br>
    <p>We worship you, Lord Christ,</p>
    <p>our Savior and our King,</p>
    <p>to you our youth and strength</p>
    <p>adoringly we bring:</p>
    <p>so fill our hearts, that all may view</p>
    <p>your life in us, and turn to you.</p>
