    <h3>Shout, for the Blessed Jesus Reigns!</h3>

    <p>1. Shout, for the blessed Jesus reigns;</p>
    <p>through distant lands his triumphs spread;</p>
    <p>and sinners, freed from endless pains,</p>
    <p>own him their Savior and their Head.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. He calls his chosen from afar;</p>
    <p>they all at Zion’s gates arrive;</p>
    <p>those who were dead in sin before</p>
    <p>by sov’reign grace are made alive.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. Gentiles and Jews his laws obey;</p>
    <p>nations remote their off’rings bring,</p>
    <p>and unconstrained their homage pay</p>
    <p>to their exalted God and King.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. O may his holy church increase,</p>
    <p>his Word and Spirit still prevail,</p>
    <p>while angels celebrate his praise,</p>
    <p>and saints his growing glories hail.</p>
    <br>
    <p>5. Loud hallelujahs to the Lamb,</p>
    <p>from all below and all above!</p>
    <p>In lofty songs exalt his name,</p>
    <p>in songs as lasting as his love.</p>
