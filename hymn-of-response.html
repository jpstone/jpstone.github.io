    <h3>Who with God Most High Finds Shelter</h3>

    <p>Who with God Most High finds shelter,</p>
    <p>lives in God Almighty’s shade.</p>
    <p>I will say to God, “My God, my</p>
    <p>fortress where my trust is stayed.”</p>
    <p>From the fowler’s snare he’ll save you,</p>
    <p>from the deadly pestilence;</p>
    <p>cover you with outspread pinions,</p>
    <p>make his wings your confidence.</p>
    <br>
    <p>God’s truth is your shield and buckler;</p>
    <p>you will fear no ill by night,</p>
    <p>nor the shafts in daylight flying,</p>
    <p>nor disease that shuns the light,</p>
    <p>nor the plague that wastes at noonday.</p>
    <p>At your side ten thousand fall;</p>
    <p>you will only see the judgment</p>
    <p>which the wicked will befall.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You have made the LORD your refuge,</p>
    <p>God Most High your dwelling place.</p>
    <p>Nothing evil shall befall you;</p>
    <p>near your tent no scourge you’ll face.</p>
    <p>He will angels charge to keep you,</p>
    <p>guard you well in all your ways,</p>
    <p>bear you up with hands that hold you,</p>
    <p>lest your foot a stone should graze.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You shall trample serpents, lions,</p>
    <p>tread on all your deadly foes.</p>
    <p>“Since he loves me, I will save him,</p>
    <p>keep him, for my name he knows;</p>
    <p>I will honor, I will save him;</p>
    <p>when he calls, I will reply.</p>
    <p>I will show him my salvation,</p>
    <p>with long life will satisfy.”</p>
