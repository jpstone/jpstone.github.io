    <h3>As the Deer Pants for the Waters</h3>

    <p>1.As the deer pants for the waters,</p>
    <p>pants my soul for you, O God.</p>
    <p>For my God my soul is thirsty,</p>
    <p>thirsting for the living God.</p>
    <p>When shall I, O God of grace,</p>
    <p>come and stand before your face?</p>
    <p>Day and night my tears sustain me;</p>
    <p>“Where’s your God?” they say to shame me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2.In my grief I still remember</p>
    <p>how I led the happy throng</p>
    <p>to the house of God for feasting,</p>
    <p>filled with shouts and joyful songs.</p>
    <p>O my soul, why so cast down?</p>
    <p>Why so troubled in me now?</p>
    <p>Hope in God, for I shall praise him;</p>
    <p>he’s my God and my salvation.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3.From the land beyond the Jordan,</p>
    <p>I remember you in prayer,</p>
    <p>from Mount Mizar and Mount Hermon,</p>
    <p>when my soul is in despair.</p>
    <p>At your waterfalls’ great roar</p>
    <p>deep calls out to deep once more.</p>
    <p>All your breakers crash against me;</p>
    <p>overwhelming waves oppress me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4.In the day, the LORD shows mercy;</p>
    <p>he commands his steadfast love.</p>
    <p>In the night, his song is with me,</p>
    <p>as I pray to God, my life.</p>
    <p>Then to God, my rock, I plead:</p>
    <p>“Why have you forgotten me?</p>
    <p>Why must I continue weeping</p>
    <p>while my life my foes are seeking?”</p>
    <br>
    <p>5.As a blow that breaks my body,</p>
    <p>all my foes are taunting me.</p>
    <p>All day long their words assault me;</p>
    <p>“Where’s your God?” they say with glee.</p>
    <p>O my soul, why so cast down?</p>
    <p>Why so troubled in me now?</p>
    <p>Hope in God, for I shall praise him,</p>
    <p>he’s my God and my salvation.</p>
