    <h3>O Love of God, How Strong and True</h3>

    <p>1. O love of God, how strong and true,</p>
    <p>eternal and yet ever new,</p>
    <p>uncomprehended and unbought,</p>
    <p>beyond all knowledge and all thought!</p>
    <p>O love of God, how deep and great,</p>
    <p>far deeper than man’s deepest hate;</p>
    <p>self-fed, self-kindled like the light,</p>
    <p>changeless, eternal, infinite.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. O heav’nly love, how precious still,</p>
    <p>in days of weariness and ill,</p>
    <p>in nights of pain and helplessness,</p>
    <p>to heal, to comfort, and to bless!</p>
    <p>O wide-embracing, wondrous love!</p>
    <p>We read you in the sky above,</p>
    <p>we read you in the earth below,</p>
    <p>in seas that swell and streams that flow.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. We read you best in him who came</p>
    <p>bearing for us the cross of shame;</p>
    <p>sent by the Father from on high,</p>
    <p>our life to live, our death to die.</p>
    <p>We read your pow’r to bless and save,</p>
    <p>e’en in the darkness of the grave;</p>
    <p>still more in resurrection light</p>
    <p>we read the fullness of your might.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. O love of God, our shield and stay</p>
    <p>through all the perils of our way!</p>
    <p>Eternal love, in you we rest,</p>
    <p>forever safe, forever blest.</p>
    <p>We will exalt you, God and King,</p>
    <p>and we will ever praise your name;</p>
    <p>we will extol you ev’ry day,</p>
    <p>and evermore your praise proclaim.</p>
