    <h3>Now Blessed Be the Lord</h3>

    <p>1. Now blessed be the LORD,</p>
    <p>my rock of strength and might,</p>
    <p>who trains my hands for war,</p>
    <p>my fingers for the fight.</p>
    <p>My saving love and fort is he,</p>
    <p>my tow’r and shield to whom I flee,</p>
    <p>subduing peoples under me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. O LORD, what then is man,</p>
    <p>that you consider him—</p>
    <p>the son of man, that you</p>
    <p>should still remember him?</p>
    <p>Man’s life is like a breath of wind;</p>
    <p>his days are quickly at an end,</p>
    <p>as passing shadows soon are spent.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. O LORD, divide your heav’ns,</p>
    <p>and come down from the skies!</p>
    <p>And touch the mountains high,</p>
    <p>that smoke from them might rise!</p>
    <p>Make lightning flash against your foe.</p>
    <p>Send out your arrows, let them go</p>
    <p>to rout and scatter them in woe.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. From heaven stretch your hand;</p>
    <p>reach down to rescue me,</p>
    <p>and save me from the floods,</p>
    <p>from strangers set me free,</p>
    <p>whose mouths are full of empty lies,</p>
    <p>whose right hand falsehood will devise,</p>
    <p>a hand which falsely testifies.</p>
    <br>
    <p>5. I sing to you, O God,</p>
    <p>a new song I will raise;</p>
    <p>upon a ten-stringed harp,</p>
    <p>my song for you I play.</p>
    <p>You give to kings the victory;</p>
    <p>you set your servant David free</p>
    <p>from brutal swords of cruelty.</p>
    <br>
    <p>6. From foreign hands, O LORD,</p>
    <p>I pray, deliver me.</p>
    <p>Reach down to rescue me,</p>
    <p>from strangers set me free,</p>
    <p>whose mouths are full of empty lies,</p>
    <p>whose right hand falsehood will devise,</p>
    <p>a hand which falsely testifies.</p>
    <br>
    <p>7. O may our sons in youth</p>
    <p>be sturdy plants full grown,</p>
    <p>our daughters carved like pillars</p>
    <p>in the palace stone.</p>
    <p>O may our barns with grain be filled,</p>
    <p>and may our sheepfold thousands yield,</p>
    <p>yes, tens of thousands in our fields.</p>
    <br>
    <p>8. O may our cows bear young</p>
    <p>with no disease or loss,</p>
    <p>and may our streets be free</p>
    <p>of mourning and distress.</p>
    <p>How blessed all the people are</p>
    <p>on whom such blessings are outpoured—</p>
    <p>how blest are they whose God is LORD!</body>p>
