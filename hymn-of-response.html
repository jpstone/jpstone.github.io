    <h3>How Shall the Young Direct Their Way?</h3>

    <p>How shall the young direct their way?</p>
    <p>What light shall be their perfect guide?</p>
    <p>Your word, O LORD, will safely lead,</p>
    <p>if in its wisdom they confide.</p>
    <p>Sincerely I have sought you, LORD,</p>
    <p>O let me not from you depart;</p>
    <p>to know your will and keep from sin</p>
    <p>your word I cherish in my heart.</p>
    <br>
    <p>O blessed LORD, teach me your law,</p>
    <p>your righteous judgments I declare;</p>
    <p>your testimonies make me glad,</p>
    <p>for they are wealth beyond compare.</p>
    <p>Upon your precepts and your ways</p>
    <p>my heart will meditate with awe;</p>
    <p>your word shall be my chief delight,</p>
    <p>and I will not forget your law.</p>
