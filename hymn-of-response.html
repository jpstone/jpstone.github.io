    <h3>Psalm 79-A</h3>

    <p>1.God, the nations have invaded</p>
    <p>and attacked your heritage;</p>
    <p>they defiled your holy temple,</p>
    <p>crushed Jerusalem in rage.</p>
    <p>They have giv’n your servants’ bodies</p>
    <p>to the birds of prey as meat,</p>
    <p>and the corpses of your faithful</p>
    <p>to wild animals to eat.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2.They have poured out blood like water</p>
    <p>all around Jerusalem.</p>
    <p>There was no one there to bury</p>
    <p>all the bodies of the dead.</p>
    <p>We’ve become to all our neighbors</p>
    <p>a derision and reproach.</p>
    <p>We are scorned by those who mock us,</p>
    <p>those who now on us encroach.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3.LORD, how long? Will your displeasure</p>
    <p>carry on and never tire?</p>
    <p>Will your jealous anger burn, LORD,</p>
    <p>like an all-consuming fire?</p>
    <p>Pour your fury on the nations</p>
    <p>that reject your holy name,</p>
    <p>all the kingdoms which devour and</p>
    <p>shatter Jacob’s dwelling place.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4.Lord, remember not against us</p>
    <p>all our sins of long ago;</p>
    <p>may your mercy quickly meet us—</p>
    <p>you have brought us very low.</p>
    <p>Help us, God of our salvation,</p>
    <p>for the glory of your name.</p>
    <p>For your name’s sake come and save us,</p>
    <p>cover all our sin and shame.</p>
    <br>
    <p>5.Why should nations all around us</p>
    <p>come and say, “Where is your God?”</p>
    <p>Let the nations know your vengeance</p>
    <p>for your servants’ outpoured blood.</p>
    <p>May the groans of ev’rypris’ner</p>
    <p>come before your throne on high;</p>
    <p>and according to your power</p>
    <p>save all those condemned to die.</p>
    <br>
    <p>6.Lord, reward our taunting neighbors,</p>
    <p>for they treated you with scorn;</p>
    <p>in their laps, O Lord, deliver</p>
    <p>sev’nfold judgment in return.</p>
    <p>Then shall we, your sheep, your people,</p>
    <p>give you thanks forevermore,</p>
    <p>and thro’ ev’ry generation</p>
    <p>your unending praise record.</p>
