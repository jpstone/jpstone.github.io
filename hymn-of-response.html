    <h3>The Earth and its Riches</h3>

    <p>1.The earth and its riches abundantly stored,</p>
    <p>the world and its dwellers belong to the LORD.</p>
    <p>For he on the seas its foundations has laid,</p>
    <p>and firm on the waters its pillars has stayed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2.O who shall the mount of the LORD God ascend?</p>
    <p>And who in the place of his holiness stand?</p>
    <p>The man of pure heart and of hands without stain,</p>
    <p>who swears not to idols, nor serves what is vain.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3.Yes, he from the LORD shall a blessing receive;</p>
    <p>the God of salvation shall righteousness give.</p>
    <p>Thus looking to him is a whole blessed race;</p>
    <p>all those who, like Jacob, are seeking your face.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4.O gates, lift your heads! Ancient doors, lift them high!</p>
    <p>The great King of glory to enter draws nigh!</p>
    <p>O who is the King that in glory draws near?</p>
    <p>The LORD, mighty LORD of the battle, is here!</p>
    <br>
    <p>5.O gates, lift your heads! Ancient doors, lift them high!</p>
    <p>The great King of glory to enter draws nigh!</p>
    <p>This great King of glory, O who can he be?</p>
    <p>The LORD God of hosts, King of glory is he!</p>
