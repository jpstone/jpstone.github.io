    <h3>How Shall They Hear</h3>

    <p>1. How shall they hear the word of God</p>
    <p>unless his truth is told?</p>
    <p>How shall the sinful be set free,</p>
    <p>the sorrowful consoled?</p>
    <p>To all who speak the truth today,</p>
    <p>impart your Spirit, Lord, we pray.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. How shall they call to God for help</p>
    <p>unless they have believed?</p>
    <p>How shall the poor be given hope,</p>
    <p>the prisoner reprieved?</p>
    <p>To those who help the blind to see,</p>
    <p>give light and love and clarity.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. How shall the gospel be proclaimed</p>
    <p>that sinners may repent?</p>
    <p>How shall the world find peace at last</p>
    <p>if heralds are not sent?</p>
    <p>So send us, Lord, for we rejoice</p>
    <p>to speak of Christ with life and voice.</p>
