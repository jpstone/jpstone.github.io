    <h3>God, My King, Thy Might Confessing</h3>

    <p>God, my king, thy might confessing,</p>
    <p>ever will I bless thy name;</p>
    <p>day by day thy throne addressing,</p>
    <p>still will I thy praise proclaim.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Honor great our God befitteth;</p>
    <p>who his majesty can reach?</p>
    <p>Age to age his works transmitteth;</p>
    <p>age to age his pow’r shall teach.</p>
    <br>
    <p>They shall talk of all thy glory,</p>
    <p>on thy might and greatness dwell,</p>
    <p>speak of thy great acts the story,</p>
    <p>and thy deeds of wonder tell.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Nor shall fail from mem’ry’s treasure</p>
    <p>works by love and mercy wrought:</p>
    <p>works of love surpassing measure,</p>
    <p>works of mercy passing thought.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Full of kindness and compassion,</p>
    <p>slow to anger, vast in love,</p>
    <p>God is good to all creation;</p>
    <p>all his works his goodness prove.</p>
    <br>
    <p>All thy works, O Lord, shall bless thee,</p>
    <p>thee shall all thy saints adore.</p>
    <p>King supreme shall they confess thee,</p>
    <p>and proclaim thy sovereign pow’r.</p>
