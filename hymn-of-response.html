    <h3>The Son of God Goes Forth to War</h3>

    <p>1. The Son of God goes forth to war,</p>
    <p>a kingly crown to gain;</p>
    <p>his blood-red banner streams afar:</p>
    <p>who follows in his train?</p>
    <p>Who best can drink his cup of woe,</p>
    <p>triumphant over pain,</p>
    <p>who patient bears his cross below,</p>
    <p>he follows in his train.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. The martyr first, whose eagle eye</p>
    <p>could pierce beyond the grave,</p>
    <p>who saw his Master in the sky</p>
    <p>and called on him to save:</p>
    <p>like him, with pardon on his tongue</p>
    <p>in midst of mortal pain,</p>
    <p>he prayed for them that did the wrong:</p>
    <p>who follows in his train?</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. A glorious band, the chosen few</p>
    <p>on whom the Spirit came,</p>
    <p>twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew,</p>
    <p>and mocked the cross and flame:</p>
    <p>they met the tyrant’s brandished steel,</p>
    <p>the lion’s gory mane;</p>
    <p>they bowed their necks the death to feel:</p>
    <p>who follows in their train?</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. A noble army, men and boys,</p>
    <p>the matron and the maid,</p>
    <p>around the Savior’s throne rejoice,</p>
    <p>in robes of light arrayed:</p>
    <p>they climbed the steep ascent of heav’n</p>
    <p>thro’ peril, toil, and pain:</p>
    <p>O God, to us may grace be giv’n</p>
    <p>to follow in their train.</p>
