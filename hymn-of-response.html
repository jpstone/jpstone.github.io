    <h3>Psalm 46-C</h3>

    <p>God is our refuge and our strength,</p>
    <p>a helper ever near us.</p>
    <p>We will not fear though earth be moved,</p>
    <p>for God is nigh to cheer us.</p>
    <p>Although the mountains quake</p>
    <p>and earth’s foundations shake,</p>
    <p>though angry billows roar</p>
    <p>and break against the shore,</p>
    <p>our mighty God will hear us.</p>
    <br>
    <p>God’s city is forever blest</p>
    <p>with living waters welling;</p>
    <p>since God is there, she stands unmoved</p>
    <p>’mid tumults round her swelling.</p>
    <p>God speaks and all is peace,</p>
    <p>from war the nations cease;</p>
    <p>the Lord of hosts is nigh.</p>
    <p>Our father’s God Most High</p>
    <p>is our eternal dwelling.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Behold what God has done on earth;</p>
    <p>his wrath brings desolation.</p>
    <p>His grace, commanding wars to cease,</p>
    <p>brings peace to ev’ry nation.</p>
    <p>Be still, for he is Lord,</p>
    <p>by all the earth adored;</p>
    <p>the Lord of hosts is nigh.</p>
    <p>Our father’s God Most High</p>
    <p>is our strong habitation.</p>
