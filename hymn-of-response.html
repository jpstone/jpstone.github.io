    <h3>For All the Saints</h3>

    <p>1. For all the saints who from their labors rest,</p>
    <p>who thee by faith before the world confessed,</p>
    <p>thy name, O Jesus, be forever blest.</p>
    <p>Alleluia! Alleluia!</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Thou wast their rock, their fortress, and their might;</p>
    <p>thou, Lord, their captain in the well-fought fight;</p>
    <p>thou, in the darkness drear, their one true light.</p>
    <p>Alleluia! Alleluia!</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. O may thy soldiers, faithful, true, and bold,</p>
    <p>fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,</p>
    <p>and win with them the victor’s crown of gold.</p>
    <p>Alleluia! Alleluia!</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. O blest communion, fellowship divine,</p>
    <p>we feebly struggle, they in glory shine;</p>
    <p>yet all are one in thee, for all are thine.</p>
    <p>Alleluia! Alleluia!</p>
    <br>
    <p>5. And when the fight is fierce, the warfare long,</p>
    <p>steals on the ear the distant triumph song,</p>
    <p>and hearts are brave again, and arms are strong.</p>
    <p>Alleluia! Alleluia!</p>
    <br>
    <p>6. The golden evening brightens in the west;</p>
    <p>soon, soon to faithful warriors cometh rest;</p>
    <p>sweet is the calm of paradise the blest.</p>
    <p>Alleluia! Alleluia!</p>
    <br>
    <p>7. But lo! there breaks a yet more glorious day;</p>
    <p>the saints triumphant rise in bright array;</p>
    <p>the King of glory passes on his way.</p>
    <p>Alleluia! Alleluia!</p>
    <br>
    <p>8. From earth’s wide bounds, from ocean’s farthest coast,</p>
    <p>through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,</p>
    <p>singing to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</p>
    <p>Alleluia! Alleluia!</p>
