    <h3>Your Hand, O God, Has Guided</h3>

    <p>Your hand, O God, has guided</p>
    <p>your flock from age to age;</p>
    <p>your faithfulness is written</p>
    <p>on history’s open page.</p>
    <p>Our fathers owned your goodness,</p>
    <p>and we their deeds record;</p>
    <p>and both to this bear witness:</p>
    <p>one church, one faith, one Lord!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Your heralds brought the gospel</p>
    <p>to greatest and the least;</p>
    <p>they summoned men and women</p>
    <p>to share the great King’s feast.</p>
    <p>And this was all their teaching</p>
    <p>in ev’ry deed and word,</p>
    <p>to all alike proclaiming:</p>
    <p>one church, one faith, one Lord!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Your mercy will not fail us</p>
    <p>nor leave your work undone;</p>
    <p>with your right hand to help us</p>
    <p>the vict’ry shall be won.</p>
    <p>And then by earth and heaven</p>
    <p>your name shall be adored;</p>
    <p>and this shall be our anthem:</p>
    <p>one church, one faith, one Lord!</p>
