    <h3>Soul, Adorn Yourself with Gladness</h3>

    <p>1. Soul, adorn yourself with gladness,</p>
    <p>leave the gloomy haunts of sadness,</p>
    <p>come into the daylight’s splendor,</p>
    <p>there with joy your praises render.</p>
    <p>Bless the One whose grace unbounded</p>
    <p>this amazing banquet founded;</p>
    <p>he, tho’ heav’nly, high and holy,</p>
    <p>deigns to dwell with you most lowly.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Hasten as a bride to meet him,</p>
    <p>eagerly and gladly greet him.</p>
    <p>There he stands already knocking;</p>
    <p>quickly, now, your gate unlocking,</p>
    <p>open wide the fast-closed portal,</p>
    <p>saying to the Lord immortal:</p>
    <p>“Come, and leave your loved one never;</p>
    <p>dwell within my heart forever.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. Now in faith I humbly ponder</p>
    <p>over this surpassing wonder</p>
    <p>that the bread of life is boundless,</p>
    <p>though the souls it feeds are countless;</p>
    <p>with the choicest wine of heaven</p>
    <p>Christ’s own blood to us is given.</p>
    <p>Oh, most glorious consolation,</p>
    <p>pledge and seal of my salvation.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. Jesus, source of lasting pleasure,</p>
    <p>truest friend and dearest treasure,</p>
    <p>peace beyond all understanding,</p>
    <p>joy into all life expanding:</p>
    <p>humbly now, I bow before you,</p>
    <p>love incarnate, I adore you;</p>
    <p>worthily let me receive you,</p>
    <p>and, so favored, never leave you.</p>
