    <h3>Psalm 144-A vv. 5-8</h3>

    <p>I sing to you, O God,</p>
    <p>a new song I will raise;</p>
    <p>upon a ten-stringed harp,</p>
    <p>my song for you I play.</p>
    <p>You give to kings the victory;</p>
    <p>you set your servant David free</p>
    <p>from brutal swords of cruelty.</p>
    <br>
    <p>From foreign hands, O LORD,</p>
    <p>I pray, deliver me.</p>
    <p>Reach down to rescue me,</p>
    <p>from strangers set me free,</p>
    <p>whose mouths are full of empty lies,</p>
    <p>whose right hand falsehood will devise,</p>
    <p>a hand which falsely testifies.</p>
    <br>
    <p>O may our sons in youth</p>
    <p>be sturdy plants full grown,</p>
    <p>our daughters carved like pillars</p>
    <p>in the palace stone.</p>
    <p>O may our barns with grain be filled,</p>
    <p>and may our sheepfold thousands yield,</p>
    <p>yes, tens of thousands in our fields.</p>
    <br>
    <p>O may our cows bear young</p>
    <p>with no disease or loss,</p>
    <p>and may our streets be free</p>
    <p>of mourning and distress.</p>
    <p>How blessed all the people are</p>
    <p>on whom such blessings are outpouredâ€”</p>
    <p>how blest are they whose God is LORD!</p>
