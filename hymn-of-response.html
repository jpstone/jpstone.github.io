    <h3>All My Heart this Night Rejoices</h3>

    <p>All my heart this night rejoices</p>
    <p>as I hear far and near</p>
    <p>sweetest angel voices.</p>
    <p>“Christ is born,” their choirs are singing</p>
    <p>’til the air ev’rywhere</p>
    <p>now with joy is ringing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Forth today the Conqu’ror goeth,</p>
    <p>who the foe, sin and woe,</p>
    <p>death and hell, o’erthroweth.</p>
    <p>God is man, man to deliver;</p>
    <p>his dear Son now is one</p>
    <p>with our blood forever.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Shall we still dread God’s displeasure,</p>
    <p>who, to save, freely gave</p>
    <p>his most cherished Treasure?</p>
    <p>To redeem us, he hath given</p>
    <p>his own Son from the throne</p>
    <p>of his might in heaven.</p>
    <br>
    <p>He becomes the Lamb that taketh</p>
    <p>sin away and for aye</p>
    <p>full atonement maketh.</p>
    <p>For our life his own he tenders;</p>
    <p>and our race, by his grace,</p>
    <p>fit for glory renders.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Hark! a voice from yonder manger,</p>
    <p>soft and sweet, doth entreat,</p>
    <p>“Flee from woe and danger.</p>
    <p>Brethren, from all ills that grieve you,</p>
    <p>you are freed; all you need</p>
    <p>I will surely give you.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>Come, then, banish all your sadness,</p>
    <p>one and all, great and small;</p>
    <p>come with songs of gladness.</p>
    <p>Love him who with love is glowing;</p>
    <p>hail the star, near and far</p>
    <p>light and joy bestowing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Dearest Lord, thee will I cherish.</p>
    <p>Though my breath fail in death,</p>
    <p>yet I shall not perish,</p>
    <p>but with thee abide forever</p>
    <p>there on high, in that joy</p>
    <p>which can vanish never.</p>
