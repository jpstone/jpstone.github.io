    <h3>The Church's One Foundation</h3>

    <p>1. The church’s one foundation</p>
    <p>is Jesus Christ, her Lord;</p>
    <p>she is his new creation</p>
    <p>by water and the Word:</p>
    <p>from heav’n he came and sought her</p>
    <p>to be his holy bride;</p>
    <p>with his own blood he bought her,</p>
    <p>and for her life he died.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Elect from ev’ry nation,</p>
    <p>yet one o’er all the earth,</p>
    <p>her charter of salvation</p>
    <p>one Lord, one faith, one birth;</p>
    <p>one holy name she blesses,</p>
    <p>partakes one holy food,</p>
    <p>and to one hope she presses,</p>
    <p>with ev’ry grace endued.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. Though with a scornful wonder</p>
    <p>men see her sore oppressed,</p>
    <p>by schisms rent asunder,</p>
    <p>by heresies distressed,</p>
    <p>yet saints their watch are keeping,</p>
    <p>their cry goes up, “How long?”</p>
    <p>And soon the night of weeping</p>
    <p>shall be the morn of song.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. The church shall never perish!</p>
    <p>Her dear Lord to defend,</p>
    <p>to guide, sustain, and cherish,</p>
    <p>is with her to the end;</p>
    <p>though there be those that hate her,</p>
    <p>and false sons in her pale,</p>
    <p>against both foe and traitor</p>
    <p>she ever shall prevail.</p>
    <br>
    <p>5. ’Mid toil and tribulation,</p>
    <p>and tumult of her war,</p>
    <p>she waits the consummation</p>
    <p>of peace forevermore;</p>
    <p>till with the vision glorious</p>
    <p>her longing eyes are blest,</p>
    <p>and the great church victorious</p>
    <p>shall be the church at rest.</p>
    <br>
    <p>6. Yet she on earth hath union</p>
    <p>with God the Three in One,</p>
    <p>and mystic sweet communion</p>
    <p>with those whose rest is won:</p>
    <p>O happy ones and holy!</p>
    <p>Lord, give us grace that we,</p>
    <p>like them, the meek and lowly,</p>
    <p>on high may dwell with thee.</p>
