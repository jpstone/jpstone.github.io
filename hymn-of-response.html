    <h3>May the Mind of Christ, My Savior</h3>

    <p>May the mind of Christ, my Savior,</p>
    <p>live in me from day to day,</p>
    <p>by his love and pow’r controlling</p>
    <p>all I do and say.</p>
    <br>
    <p>May the Word of God dwell richly</p>
    <p>in my heart from hour to hour,</p>
    <p>so that all may see I triumph</p>
    <p>only through his pow’r.</p>
    <br>
    <p>May the peace of God my Father</p>
    <p>rule my life in ev’rything,</p>
    <p>that I may be calm to comfort</p>
    <p>sick and sorrowing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>May the love of Jesus fill me</p>
    <p>as the waters fill the sea;</p>
    <p>him exalting, self-abasing:</p>
    <p>this is victory.</p>
    <br>
    <p>May I run the race before me,</p>
    <p>strong and brave to face the foe,</p>
    <p>looking only unto Jesus</p>
    <p>as I onward go.</p>
    <br>
    <p>May his beauty rest upon me</p>
    <p>as I seek the lost to win,</p>
    <p>and may they forget the channel,</p>
    <p>seeing only him.</p>
