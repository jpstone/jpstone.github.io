    <h3>The One Who Dwells in God</h3>

    <p>1.The one who dwells in God as his abode,</p>
    <p>within the shadow of th’Almighty rests.</p>
    <p>“He is my refuge,” I say of the LORD,</p>
    <p>“My fortress sure, my God; in him I trust.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>2.He surely saves you from the fowler’s snare</p>
    <p>and rescues you from deadly pestilence.</p>
    <p>Under his wings a refuge you will find;</p>
    <p>your strong defense will be his faithfulness.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3.You will not fear the terror of the night,</p>
    <p>nor arrows flying in the light of day,</p>
    <p>nor the disease which stalks you in the dark,</p>
    <p>nor plague of noon that will destruction lay.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4.Tho’ thousands fall, ten thousand at your right,</p>
    <p>no harm will come to you or near you stand.</p>
    <p>Your eyes will then look on, and you will see</p>
    <p>the wicked punished as their ways demand.</p>
    <br>
    <p>5.Because you make the LORD your dwelling place—</p>
    <p>the Most High God, who is my refuge sure—</p>
    <p>no evil then will ever on you fall,</p>
    <p>nor dire calamity come near your door.</p>
    <br>
    <p>6. For he will charge his angels with your care,</p>
    <p>to guard your ways, your footsteps every one;</p>
    <p>they will uphold and bear you in their hands,</p>
    <p>lest you should strike your foot against a stone.</p>
    <br>
    <p>7. Upon the mighty lion you will tread;</p>
    <p>the cobra you will overcome and kill.</p>
    <p>Your feet will trample down the king of beasts;</p>
    <p>the serpent will be crushed beneath your heel.</p>
    <br>
    <p>8. “Because he loves me,” says the Sov’reignLORD,</p>
    <p>“I will deliver him and keep from harm.</p>
    <p>Since he acknowledges my holy name,</p>
    <p>I will protect him with my mighty arm.</p>
    <br>
    <p>9. “On me he calls, and I will answer him;</p>
    <p>in time of trouble I with him will be.</p>
    <p>I will deliver him and honor give.</p>
    <p>Long will he live, and my salvation see.”</p>
