    <h3>Take My Life, and Let it Be</h3>

    <p>Take my life, and let it be</p>
    <p>consecrated, Lord, to thee.</p>
    <p>Take my moments and my days;</p>
    <p>let them flow in ceaseless praise,</p>
    <p>let them flow in ceaseless praise.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Take my hands, and let them move</p>
    <p>at the impulse of thy love.</p>
    <p>Take my feet, and let them be</p>
    <p>swift and beautiful for thee,</p>
    <p>swift and beautiful for thee.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Take my voice, and let me sing</p>
    <p>always, only, for my King.</p>
    <p>Take my lips, and let them be</p>
    <p>filled with messages from thee,</p>
    <p>filled with messages from thee.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Take my silver and my gold;</p>
    <p>not a mite would I withhold.</p>
    <p>Take my intellect and use</p>
    <p>ev’ry pow’r as thou shalt choose,</p>
    <p>ev’ry pow’r as thou shalt choose.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Take my will and make it thine;</p>
    <p>it shall be no longer mine.</p>
    <p>Take my heart, it is thine own;</p>
    <p>it shall be thy royal throne,</p>
    <p>it shall be thy royal throne.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Take my love; my Lord, I pour</p>
    <p>at thy feet its treasure-store.</p>
    <p>Take my self, and I will be</p>
    <p>ever, only, all for thee,</p>
    <p>ever, only, all for thee.</p>
