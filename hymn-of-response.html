    <h3>God is Our Refuge and Our Strength</h3>

    <p>God is our refuge and our strength,</p>
    <p>ever-present aid;</p>
    <p>and therefore, though the earth gives way,</p>
    <p>we will not be afraid.</p>
    <p>Though mountains fall into the sea,</p>
    <p>though waters foam and roar,</p>
    <p>we will not fear, though mountains quake</p>
    <p>as waves engulf the shore.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A river flows, whose streams delight</p>
    <p>the city of our Godâ€”</p>
    <p>the holy place where God the LORD</p>
    <p>Most High makes his abode.</p>
    <p>Since God is in her holy midst,</p>
    <p>the city will not move,</p>
    <p>for God will come at break of day;</p>
    <p>her helper he will prove.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The nations rage, the kingdoms shake,</p>
    <p>when God in might appears.</p>
    <p>He speaks, and at his mighty voice</p>
    <p>the whole earth melts in fear.</p>
    <p>The LORD of hosts, Almighty God,</p>
    <p>is with us to the end,</p>
    <p>the God of Jacob is for us</p>
    <p>a fortress and defense.</p>
    <br>
    <p>O come, behold the mighty works</p>
    <p>that God the LORD has wrought,</p>
    <p>the fearsome desolations he</p>
    <p>to all the lands has brought.</p>
    <p>He causes wars to cease on earth;</p>
    <p>he breaks the bow and spear.</p>
    <p>The LORD ignites the chariots</p>
    <p>to burn in blazing fire.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Be still, and know that I am God,</p>
    <p>on earth exalted high;</p>
    <p>and all the nations of the world</p>
    <p>my name will glorify.</p>
    <p>The LORD of hosts, Almighty God,</p>
    <p>is with us to the end;</p>
    <p>the God of Jacob is for us</p>
    <p>a fortress and defense.</p>
