    <h3>Come to the Waters</h3>

    <p>Come to the waters, whoever is thirsty;</p>
    <p>drink from the Fountain that never runs dry.</p>
    <p>Jesus, the Living One, offers you mercy,</p>
    <p>life more abundant in boundless supply.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Come to the River that flows thro’ the city,</p>
    <p>forth from the throne of the Father and Son.</p>
    <p>Jesus, the Savior, says, “Come and drink deeply.”</p>
    <p>Drink from the pure, inexhaustible One.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Come to the Fountain without any money;</p>
    <p>buy what is given without any cost.</p>
    <p>Jesus, the gracious One, welcomes the weary;</p>
    <p>Jesus, the selfless One, died for the lost.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Come to the Well of unmerited favor;</p>
    <p>stretch out your hand; fill your cup to the brim.</p>
    <p>Jesus is such a compassionate Savior.</p>
    <p>Draw from the grace that flows freely from him.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Come to the Savior, the God of salvation.</p>
    <p>God has provided an end to sin’s strife.</p>
    <p>Why will you suffer the Law’s condemnation?</p>
    <p>Take the free gift of the water of life.</p>
