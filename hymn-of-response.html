    <h3>If Thou But Suffer God to Guide Thee</h3>

    <p>If thou but suffer God to guide thee,</p>
    <p>and hope in him through all your ways,</p>
    <p>he’ll give thee strength, whate’er betide thee,</p>
    <p>and bear thee through the evil days:</p>
    <p>who trusts in God’s unchanging love</p>
    <p>builds on the Rock that naught can move.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What can these anxious cares avail thee,</p>
    <p>these never-ceasing moans and sighs?</p>
    <p>What can it help, if thou bewail thee</p>
    <p>o’er each dark moment as it flies?</p>
    <p>Our cross and trials do but press</p>
    <p>the heavier for our bitterness.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Only be still, and wait his leisure</p>
    <p>in cheerful hope, with heart content</p>
    <p>to take whate’er thy Father’s pleasure</p>
    <p>and all-discerning love hath sent;</p>
    <p>nor doubt our inmost wants are known</p>
    <p>to him who chose us for his own.</p>
    <br>
    <p>All are alike before the Highest;</p>
    <p>’tis easy to our God, we know,</p>
    <p>to raise thee up, though low thou liest,</p>
    <p>to make the rich man poor and low;</p>
    <p>true wonders still by him are wrought,</p>
    <p>who setteth up and brings to naught.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Sing, pray, and keep his ways unswerving,</p>
    <p>so do thine own part faithfully,</p>
    <p>and trust his word—though undeserving,</p>
    <p>thou yet shalt find it true for thee;</p>
    <p>God never yet forsook at need</p>
    <p>the soul that trusted him indeed.</p>
