    <h3>Zion, Founded on the Mountains</h3>

    <p>Zion, founded on the mountains,</p>
    <p>God, your builder, loves you well;</p>
    <p>glorious things of you are spoken,</p>
    <p>he delights in you to dwell;</p>
    <p>God’s own city, God’s own city, God’s own city,</p>
    <p>who can all your glory tell?</p>
    <br>
    <p>I will name as those who know me</p>
    <p>Egypt, Tyre, and Babylon;</p>
    <p>they will say of Cush and Rahab,</p>
    <p>“This one was in Zion born.”</p>
    <p>God Almighty, God Almighty, God Almighty</p>
    <p>shall establish Zion strong.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When the LORD shall count the nations,</p>
    <p>sons and daughters he shall see,</p>
    <p>born to endless life in Zion,</p>
    <p>and their joyful song shall be:</p>
    <p>“Blessed Zion, blessed Zion, blessed Zion,</p>
    <p>all our fountains are in thee.”</p>
